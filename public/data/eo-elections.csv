The bill authorizes the Secretary of State to develop and maintain a secure online platform for voter registration that allows individuals to submit registration applications electronically. Key provisions include allowing electronic signatures, establishing security measures to protect voter information, and specifying that online registration applications must meet the same requirements as traditional mail-in forms. The online system will require applicants to provide identifying information such as a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number for verification. First-time voters registering online will need to meet the same identification requirements as those registering by mail, including providing documentation when voting for the first time. The Secretary of State is tasked with creating rules for the online system, ensuring uniform application across the state, and implementing security protocols to maintain the integrity of voter registration records. The online voter registration system will become effective on January 1, 2026, giving state officials time to develop and test the new electronic registration process.","Bill","Government Affairs","Envelope Marked “Provisional”, Require Identifying Information, Current Utility Bill, Disabilities Disabilities Agencies, Identification Documents Listed, Recruitment Recruitment Offices, Public Assistance Agency, Valid Photo Identification, Valid Photographic Identification, Large Print Forms","Died in House Committee at Sine Die adjournment.","05/05/2025","6","Andrew Collins (D)*, Denise Garner (D), Tara Shephard (D), Joy Springer (D), Diana Gonzales Worthen (D), Lincoln Barnett (D)","Dead","57","1","59","11/20/2024","11/20/2024","","Support"

The legislation requires the Department of Finance and Administration to provide a monthly report to the Secretary of State listing individuals with nonimmigrant visas, who will then cross-reference these names with voter registration records. If a noncitizen is found to be registered to vote, their voter registration will be canceled, and their driver's license will be suspended. The bill mandates that driver's licenses for noncitizens will be distinctively different from standard licenses, featuring a vertical format, a ""Non-Citizen"" label, and a clear indication that the license is not valid for federal identification or voting purposes. The license will also expire concurrently with the holder's visa expiration. Additionally, the bill amends existing election laws to require election officials to be trained in recognizing and refusing driver's licenses that are not valid for voter identification. These changes aim to prevent noncitizens from voting and create a clear distinction between citizen and noncitizen driver's licenses, with the provisions set to take effect on February 1, 2025.","Bill","Government Affairs","Nonimmigrant Visa Status, Unexpired Nonimmigrant Visa, Federal Identification Purposes, Photo Identification Card, Certified Election Monitors, Voter Registration Canceled, Voter Registration Files, Voter Identification Purposes, Voter Identification Purposes”, Voter Verification Card","Died on House Calendar at Sine Die adjournment.","05/05/2025","2","Wayne Long (R)*, Mark Johnson (R)*","Dead","31","1","40","02/06/2025","02/06/2025","","Support"

Specifically, the bill modifies Section 6(a)(2) to expand the voter registration application form requirements, adding new provisions that inform applicants about potential risks of third-party voter registration organizations not delivering applications in time, and providing guidance on determining if an application has been received by the Secretary of State. The bill also updates voter eligibility criteria in Section 9(a) to explicitly include U.S. citizenship as a requirement for voter registration. In Section 11(a), the bill adds a new provision to allow cancellation of voter registrations for individuals who are not U.S. citizens. The final section includes legislative intent language, emphasizing that these changes are technical in nature and are not meant to repeal or conflict with other legislative acts from the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly. These amendments aim to clarify and improve the state's voter registration process by addressing potential grammatical errors and adding more detailed informational requirements for voter registration forms.","Bill","Government Affairs, Justice","Adjudged Mentally Incompetent, Address Confirmation Mailings, Address Confirmation Notice, Make Technical Corrections, Voter Eligibility Requirements, Voter Registration Application, Voter Registrations, Identical Print, Punctuation Error, Verify Sb","Notification that SB169 is now Act 221","02/27/2025","4","Clarke Tucker (D)*, Jimmy Gazaway (R)*, Josh Bryant (R), Matthew Shepherd (R)","Signed/Enacted/Adopted","28","2","51","01/31/2025","02/27/2025","","Support"

If the motor vehicle division identifies a registered voter who has not provided satisfactory proof of U.S. citizenship, the county recorder must send a notice giving the voter 35 days to provide valid citizenship documentation. Failure to do so will result in the voter being moved to a ""not registered"" status and becoming ineligible to vote. Voters registered on or before January 24, 2005, are grandfathered and exempt from this requirement unless they re-register in a different county. Those using a federal voter registration form may be classified as ""federal only"" voters if they cannot provide citizenship proof. If a voter does not provide citizenship evidence after the next general election, their voter registration will be canceled. The bill includes an emergency clause making it immediately operative and is set to be automatically repealed on December 31, 2026.

Specifically, the bill declares that voter eligibility for federal offices will be determined by Arizona's existing state election statutes, which include requirements related to citizenship and residency. The bill cites both the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 2) and the Arizona Constitution (Article II, Section 3) as legal foundations for this assertion of state-level electoral control. By using the phrase ""sovereign authority,"" the bill appears to be challenging federal oversight of election rules and emphasizing the state's right to independently define voter qualifications, potentially creating a framework that could limit or modify existing federal voter eligibility standards.","Bill","Justice, Military Affairs and Security","Election Statutes, Federal Offices, Including Qualifications, Local Officers, Amended, Azhb, Conduct, Elections, Read, Relating","Governor Vetoed","04/15/2025","4","Lisa Fink (R)*, Rachel Keshel (R), Khyl Powell (R), Michael Way (R)","Vetoed","33","2","21","01/08/2025","02/25/2025","","Oppose"

It allows the Secretary of State to join voter registration information-sharing organizations, but only if the organization's membership is composed solely of state election officials and includes specific confidentiality protections. The bill requires county recorders to establish a uniform voter registration list maintenance program that complies with federal voting rights laws, including sending address confirmation notices to voters who have not recently voted or updated their registration. The legislation mandates that voter registrations cannot be canceled within 90 days of a federal election and requires county recorders to report list maintenance activities to the Secretary of State twice annually. Additionally, the bill introduces new procedures for handling voter registration when a voter is potentially ineligible, such as being deceased, a convicted felon, or not a U.S. citizen, which includes suspending the registration and notifying the voter to revise or clarify their information. The Secretary of State is also required to submit an annual report detailing the membership terms of any voter registration information-sharing organization and provide information on voter removals.","Bill","Justice, Military Affairs and Security","Nonoperating Identification License, Permanent Voter File, Nongovernmental Entity Agrees, Class Mail Marked, New Residence Ballot, Tribal Enrollment Number, Voting Rights Restored, Changing Voter Registration, Voter Registration System, Address Confirmation Requests","Transmitted to Governor","05/07/2025","2","James Taylor (R)*, Lisa Fink (R)","Passed","40","3","65","01/15/2025","04/17/2025","","Support"

The bill clarifies the circumstances under which voter registration information can be accessed and used, restricting its use to political, campaign, and election-related purposes while establishing specific fees for obtaining voter records. It also reinforces the secretary of state's responsibility to maintain a statewide voter registration database that complies with federal voting laws like the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act, ensuring voter information is managed consistently across counties.

It also preserves provisions allowing people without a fixed residence (such as those experiencing homelessness) to register to vote using alternative addresses like shelters or county courthouses.

The bill also mandates strict custody and access controls for voting equipment at polling places, voting centers, and central counting centers. Specifically, any voting equipment with accessible ports must be sealed and logged in a chain of custody document, with detailed tracking of every person who handles the equipment.

The State Auditor would be tasked with periodically reviewing voter rolls to identify ineligible voters and auditing signature verification processes, with counties having more than a 5% error rate required to develop remediation plans. The bill also establishes new procedures for ballot counting, requiring elections officials to count most ballots within 72 hours of an election, and imposes penalties on counties that fail to meet these requirements, such as restricting their ability to automatically mail ballots to all registered voters in subsequent elections. Additionally, the bill repeals previous restrictions on local governments enacting voter ID requirements and adds new signature verification steps for vote-by-mail ballots, including comparing the last four digits of a voter's government-issued ID across different documents.

This change aims to ensure that only eligible U.S. citizens are provided the opportunity to register to vote through the motor voter program.

In furtherance of this responsibility, the department of state regularly and securely exchanges information with the department of revenue (DOR), the department of public health and environment (CDPHE), and the department of corrections (DOC) to enable the transfer and verification of voter registration information.

Section 2 requires the executive director of DOR to furnish 2 separate quarterly reports to the secretary of state of all persons who are not citizens based on: ! Information contained in the database of the division of motor vehicles subject to the existing sharing agreement with the department of state as modified in section 1; and ! Information obtained from the federal commissioner of social security and required to be made accessible to the department of state for verification of a person's name, date of birth, and the last 4 digits of the person's social security number. Section 2 requires the executive directors of CDPHE and DOC, respectively, to furnish the same type of quarterly report to the secretary of state based on the information in the databases of CDPHE and DOC subject to existing information-sharing agreements with the department of state and as modified in section 1. Section 2 also requires the state court administrator to provide the secretary of state with a quarterly report of all persons who report as ineligible to serve as a trial or grand juror because they are not citizens. Section 2 requires the secretary of state to forward quarterly to each county clerk and recorder the information received from the executive directors of DOR, CDPHE, DOC, and the state court administrator, and requires a county clerk and recorder to cancel the voter registration of any elector who is not a citizen according to the information received from the secretary of state.

These departments will be required to submit quarterly reports to the Secretary of State listing individuals who are not citizens, based on information in their respective databases. The State Court Administrator must also provide a quarterly report of people ineligible for jury duty due to citizenship status. County clerks will be mandated to cancel voter registrations for noncitizens based on these reports, and the Secretary of State will have the authority to electronically cancel registrations as well. The bill includes strict provisions for data security, ensuring that the reports and related information are protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. Additionally, the bill includes a standard Colorado legislative provision allowing for potential referendum, with the act potentially taking effect after the 2026 general election if challenged.

The bill requires the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to prominently display instructions for canceling voter registration, verify citizenship status during voter registration, and mark driver's licenses and identification cards of non-citizens with ""NC"". Voter registration applicants must now provide more detailed identification, including proof of United States citizenship, and third-party voter registration organizations must affirm they will not solicit non-citizens to register. The bill mandates that supervisors of elections conduct quarterly list maintenance to identify potentially ineligible voters, including those who may have moved, died, or are not United States citizens. Additionally, the bill requires voter education programs to provide more comprehensive information about voter registration, updating registration information, and the importance of canceling registration when moving out of state. First-time voters will need to provide specific forms of identification, such as a passport, birth certificate, or social security card, to verify their eligibility. The new requirements aim to enhance the accuracy and integrity of voter registration rolls and voting processes, with most provisions set to take effect on July 1, 2025.","Bill","Government Affairs","Bulk List Maintenance, Presidential Preference Primary, Motor Vehicles Indicating, Maximum Extent Feasible, Reliable Criminal Records, Driver License Classification, Driver License Examiner, Driver License Indicating, Existing Driver License, Separate Signature Consenting","Indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration","05/03/2025","6","Berny Jacques (R)*, Chase Tramont (R)*, Shane Abbott (R), Webster Barnaby (R), Kim Kendall (R), Taylor Yarkosky (R)","In Committee","7","1","119","02/20/2025","02/20/2025","","Support"

The bill introduces significant modifications to how voters register, how petitions are gathered and verified, how ballots are designed and processed, and how elections are conducted and monitored.

Key provisions include stricter requirements for voter registration and signature verification, creating new procedures for initiative and candidate petition forms, enhancing the Office of Election Crimes and Security's powers, modifying early voting and vote-by-mail ballot procedures, imposing new restrictions on who can handle petition forms and vote-by-mail ballots, and establishing more detailed canvassing and vote validation processes. The bill also adds criminal penalties for various election-related activities, such as collecting voter information improperly or accepting contributions from foreign nationals.

Some notable specific changes include requiring more detailed identification for petition signers, mandating signature matching training for election officials, creating new rules for ballot design and voting methods, expanding the powers of the Office of Election Crimes and Security to issue subpoenas, requiring more comprehensive reporting from supervisors of elections, and establishing more rigorous procedures for verifying election results. The bill also introduces new restrictions on poll watchers, changes how canvassing boards are composed, and adds new requirements for political committees and candidates.

The bill is extensive, amending or creating numerous sections of Florida's election laws, with most provisions set to take effect on July 1, 2025, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to election administration and security.","Bill","","Discretionary Sales Surtaxes, Jury Summons Cycle, Presidential Preference Primaries, Electioneering Communications Organizations, Return Pro Rata, Poll Watcher Files, Poll Watcher Pollwatcher, Petition Forms Assigned, Foregoing Petition Circulator, Early Voting Begins","Indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration","05/03/2025","2","Blaise Ingoglia (R)*, Jay Collins (R)","In Committee","4","1","212","02/26/2025","02/26/2025","","Unsure"

The legislation mandates a statewide uniform voting system using hand-marked and hand-counted paper ballots for all federal, state, and county elections, with provisions for ballot marking devices to assist voters with disabilities who cannot use hand-marked ballots. The bill requires that all voting equipment be American-owned, manufactured in the United States, and developed exclusively by American citizens, with hardware and software incapable of remote access. Counties may still purchase additional voting equipment at their own expense, and municipalities can acquire voting equipment as furnished by the state. The bill also requires all absentee ballots to be scanned at a high resolution and maintained in a digital format.

Specifically, the bill establishes a comprehensive framework for how voters can challenge the eligibility of other voters, requiring that such challenges be filed in writing at least 45 days before early voting begins. The bill outlines five specific grounds for challenges: the person is under 18, is not a U.S. citizen, has a felony conviction without restored voting rights, has been judicially declared mentally incompetent, or does not actually reside at the address listed on their voter registration. For residency challenges, the challenger must either provide the person's actual address or demonstrate due diligence in attempting to verify the voter's residence, such as sending a letter with return service, checking property records, or searching voter registration databases. Challengers must submit a signed affidavit swearing to their personal knowledge that the challenged voter is ineligible. The bill also specifies that residency challenges are only valid if the actual residence is outside the voter's registered precinct. Additionally, all challenge documents will be considered public records, and the Secretary of State is required to create a standardized challenge form available online and to county election offices.","Bill","Government Affairs","Documents Obtained Pertaining, Judicially Declared Ineligible, Return Service Requested, Signed Affidavit Swearing, Exercised Due Diligence, Required Documentation Relating, Absentee Ballot Clerk, Challenge Filed Pursuant, Residential Address Provided, Voter Registration Record","Senate Read and Referred","03/27/2025","2","Sally Harrell (D)*, Sam Watson (R)*","In Committee","2","1","54","03/25/2025","03/26/2025","","Support"

Requires eligible applicants for instruction permits, provisional licenses, driver's licenses, and identification cards to be automatically registered or preregistered to vote unless the applicant opts out. Effective 7/1/3000. (HD1)","This bill aims to strengthen Hawaii's automatic voter registration system by requiring state agencies, particularly those dealing with driver's licenses, instruction permits, and identification cards, to automatically register or preregister eligible voters unless they choose to opt out. The bill expands the existing voter registration process by mandating that applications for instruction permits, provisional licenses, driver's licenses, and identification cards now serve as voter registration opportunities. When individuals submit these applications and meet eligibility requirements (such as being a U.S. citizen and of appropriate age), their information will be electronically transmitted to county clerks, who will then send a notice allowing applicants to decline registration. If applicants do not decline within a specified timeframe, they will be automatically registered or preregistered to vote.

The bill also modifies voter declaration forms to explicitly require voters to affirm U.S. citizenship, and allows the state to use various federal and state agency information sources to verify voter eligibility. Additionally, the legislation provides mechanisms for tracking and managing voter records with different status designations (active, inactive, incomplete, pending, unconfirmed, or canceled), and ensures that provisional ballots not cured by specified deadlines will be rejected.

It introduces new requirements for early voting, including specifying permissible reasons for obtaining an early voting ballot, such as being over 80, physically unable to go to the polling place, or being absent from the county. The bill mandates that official ballots have a covert watermark and requires election officials to maintain secure ballot drop-boxes under strict video surveillance. A key provision is the requirement for hand counting ballots, which involves manually counting paper ballots without electronic devices (except calculators) and includes verifying ballot watermarks and voter signatures. The bill also changes procedures for ballot counting, requiring election commissioners to hand count at least 25% of ballots to verify electronic vote tabulation. Additionally, the legislation imposes stricter regulations on ballot agents, limits who can return ballots on behalf of a voter, and enhances overall election security measures through increased documentation, identification requirements, and monitoring procedures.","Bill","Military Affairs and Security","Place Reasonable Limits, Election Administration Fund, Address Confirmation Documents, Correct Registration Application, Corrected Registration Application, Registration Application Arrives, Polling Place Assigned, Restrict Voter Registration, Voter Registration Record, Reissue Revised Statutes","Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Hearing (13:30:00 3/5/2025 Room 1524)","03/05/2025","1","Rick Holdcroft (NP)*","In Committee","6","1","92","01/22/2025","01/22/2025","","Support"

The bill changes the absentee registration affidavit to explicitly require these documents, and clarifies that if a voter does not provide the required documentation, their application shall not be approved. For in-person absentee voting, the bill eliminates the option of completing a challenged voter affidavit and now requires voters to present a photo identification to be considered a verified voter. The bill also removes language that previously allowed alternative methods of voter verification. If a voter cannot provide the required photo ID, their ballot signatures will be compared on election day.

For indigent voters unable to obtain citizenship documentation, the bill establishes a voucher program wherein city or town clerks can provide financial assistance to help individuals obtain a certified birth certificate or equivalent proof of citizenship. The secretary of state will be required to reimburse municipalities for these vouchers and will develop a financial affidavit form to determine an individual's indigent status. To support this program, the bill appropriates $25,000 for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2026 and June 30, 2027, with the understanding that the Department of State will likely need to hire an additional staff member to coordinate citizenship verification and administer the voucher program.

Key provisions include establishing online voter registration, implementing same-day registration at polling places, creating a statewide voter hotline, mandating manual audits of election results, protecting voter privacy, and prohibiting voter suppression tactics. The bill also includes protections for individuals with disabilities, those with limited English proficiency, and military service members and their families. Notably, the bill requires robust security measures for data transmission, ensures that personal information remains confidential, and establishes penalties for misusing voter registration information.

By specifying multiple acceptable forms of documentation, the bill aims to provide flexibility while maintaining strict verification of voters' citizenship status.","Bill","","Applicable Readability Standards, Application Programming Interface, Flesch Readability Score, Registration Card Meets, Signed Registration Card, Voter Registration Card, Tribal Enrollment Number, Electron- Ically Submit, Social Security Number, Voter Registration Agency","Referred to Rules.","02/25/2025","7","Kim Thatcher (R)*, Werner Reschke (R)*, Darin Harbick (R), Cyrus Javadi (R), Kevin Mannix (R), Mark Owens (R), Boomer Wright (R)","In Committee","2","1","44","02/24/2025","02/25/2025","","Support"

The legislation creates a detailed process for voter registration that requires applicants to provide satisfactory evidence of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, passport, naturalization documents, or other government-issued documents that prove U.S. citizenship. If an applicant cannot immediately provide such documentation, their registration will be placed in a provisional status, and they will have 90 days to submit the required evidence. The bill establishes a State Election Board composed of the Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of the Commonwealth to assess citizenship documentation. To make the process more accessible, the bill mandates that the Division of Vital Records provide free birth certificates to individuals 17 and older who are seeking to register to vote and do not have other citizenship documents. County offices are required to assist individuals in obtaining these documents at no cost. The bill also provides an appeals process for applicants whose citizenship is initially questioned, allowing them to present additional evidence or seek a declaratory judgment. Importantly, individuals already registered to vote before the bill's implementation will be deemed to have satisfactory citizenship proof and will not need to submit additional documentation.","Bill","Government Affairs","American Indian Card, Expired Passport Identifying, Permanent Voter File, Relevant Election Officer, Applicant Believes Demonstrates, Equivalent Governmental Agency, Tribal Enrollment Number, Provide Qualifying Identification, Vital Records Possesses, Mailed Registration Application","Referred to STATE GOVERNMENT","01/23/2025","8","David Maloney (R)*, Marla Gallo Brown (R), Joe Hamm (R), Rob Kauffman (R), Andrew Kuzma (R), Dave Zimmerman (R), Mark Gillen (R), Alec Ryncavage (R)","In Committee","1","1","47","01/22/2025","01/24/2025","","Support"

The bill requires county election boards to notify voters within 24 hours if their identification is missing or unverified, giving them until six days after the election to submit proper identification.

The bill requires only paper poll books at voting locations, limits precinct size to 1,500-2,000 voters, and increases the number of election managers per polling place. It mandates hand-marked paper ballots with specific security features and requires hand-counting of ballots in each precinct, with public observation both in-person and online. The bill also introduces strict chain of custody requirements for all voting system components, modifies absentee voting rules to be more restrictive, and adds General Election Day as a legal holiday.

A new electronic voter registration program is established, enabling individuals with a valid Texas driver's license or personal ID to complete voter registration applications online through a secure website, with the Secretary of State comparing applicant information against Department of Public Safety records. High school deputy registrars will now be required to annually report the number of registration forms distributed and the number of students eligible to register.

Additionally, the legislation provides exceptions for voters in state-licensed care facilities and includes provisions for voters who need assistance in casting their ballot, ensuring accessibility while maintaining the integrity of the voting process.","Bill","Justice","Bioptic Telescopic Lenses, Hereinafter Expressly Exempted, Honorably Discharged Veteran, Knowingly Swears Falsely, Social Security Card, Valid Concealed Carry, Valid Bank Card, Valid Debit Card, Valid Medicare Card, Specific Voting System","To Judiciary","03/18/2025","6","Kevan Bartlett (R)*, Mike Azinger (R), Anne Charnock (R), Rollan Roberts (R), Patricia Rucker (R), Darren Thorne (R)","In Committee","4","1","88","03/18/2025","03/18/2025","","Support"

Specifically, the bill requires that a qualified elector must be a bona fide resident of Wyoming for at least 30 days before an election and must provide proof of both residence and United States citizenship when registering to vote. The bill defines ""proof of residence"" as documents specified by the secretary of state, with an option for a signed attestation if standard documents are unavailable, and ""proof of United States citizenship"" as including various forms of identification like driver's licenses, tribal ID cards, passports, birth certificates, and military records. The legislation prohibits voter registration based on documentation showing noncitizen status and requires registrants to provide specific documentation demonstrating their eligibility. The bill will become effective on July 1, 2025, with the secretary of state tasked with creating administrative rules to implement these new voter registration requirements. These changes aim to ensure that only eligible, long-term residents of Wyoming can participate in the state's elections by implementing more rigorous verification processes.","Bill","Government Affairs","Eastern Shoshone Tribe, Making Conforming Amendments, Birth Abroad Issued, Prohibiting Registration Based, Absentee Ballot Obtained, Bona Fide Resident, Absentee Registration Generally, Official Registry List, Voter Residency-Registration Qualifications, Voting Rights Restored","Assigned Chapter Number 172","03/21/2025","28","Ocean Andrew (R)*, Abby Angelos (R)*, John Bear (R)*, Laurie Bratten (R)*, Gary Brown (R)*, Kevin Campbell (R)*, Ken Clouston (R)*, Rob Geringer (R)*, Joel Guggenmos (R)*, Jeremy Haroldson (R)*, Scott Heiner (R)*, Paul Hoeft (R)*, Chris Knapp (R)*, Martha Lawley (R)*, Tony Locke (R)*, Ann Lucas (R)*, Darin McCann (R)*, Chip Neiman (R)*, Rachel Rodriguez-Williams (R)*, Joseph Webb (R)*, Nina Webber (R)*, John Winter (R)*, Brian Boner (R)*, Bob Ide (R)*, Dan Laursen (R)*, Laura Taliaferro Pearson (R)*, Darin Smith (R)*, Cheri Steinmetz (R)*","Signed/Enacted/Adopted","30","2","76","01/13/2025","02/28/2025","","Support"

The bill defines ""proof of United States citizenship"" as a comprehensive list of acceptable documents, including Wyoming driver's licenses, tribal identification cards, out-of-state driver's licenses consistent with the REAL ID Act, U.S. passports, citizenship certificates, naturalization certificates, military draft records, selective service registration cards, consular reports of birth abroad, and U.S. birth certificates. Specifically, the bill amends several sections of Wyoming's election code to mandate that voter registration forms include documentation demonstrating U.S. citizenship, and that individuals must provide such proof when registering to vote, whether in person or by absentee ballot. The new requirements aim to verify the citizenship status of potential voters more rigorously by expanding the types of acceptable documentation and explicitly requiring proof at the point of registration. The bill will become effective on July 1, 2025, giving election officials and potential voters time to adapt to the new documentation requirements.","Bill","Government Affairs","Eastern Shoshone Tribe, Making Conforming Amendments, Northern Arapaho Tribe, Birth Abroad Issued, Absentee Ballot Obtained, Official Registry List, Absentee Registration Generally, Absentee Ballot, Official Seal, Registry Agents","Did not Consider for Introduction","02/28/2025","28","Ocean Andrew (R)*, Abby Angelos (R)*, Dalton Banks (R)*, John Bear (R)*, Marlene Brady (R)*, Laurie Bratten (R)*, Gary Brown (R)*, Kevin Campbell (R)*, Ken Clouston (R)*, Rob Geringer (R)*, Joel Guggenmos (R)*, Paul Hoeft (R)*, Stephen Johnson (R)*, Chris Knapp (R)*, Martha Lawley (R)*, Tony Locke (R)*, Ann Lucas (R)*, Darin McCann (R)*, Ken Pendergraft (R)*, Daniel Singh (R)*, Scott Smith (R)*, Joseph Webb (R)*, Nina Webber (R)*, John Winter (R)*, Brian Boner (R)*, Laura Taliaferro Pearson (R)*, Darin Smith (R)*, Cheri Steinmetz (R)*","Dead","14","2","57","01/13/2025","01/20/2025","","Support"

Specifically, the bill allows the Secretary of State to use additional verification methods, including matching voter registration data with driver's license information to identify potential non-citizens or voters who have moved to another state. The bill introduces the use of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program to confirm voters' citizenship status and requires the Department of Transportation to provide monthly lists of individuals who have indicated non-citizen status. Additionally, the bill broadens the circumstances under which county clerks can investigate and potentially cancel a voter's registration, allowing them to use various investigative methods when there is evidence a voter may have moved to another state. The new provisions aim to improve the accuracy of voter rolls by providing more tools and methods for identifying and removing ineligible voters, while maintaining confidentiality of personal information.
