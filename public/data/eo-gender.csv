The bill declares that there are only two sexes (male and female), which are determined objectively at birth, and aims to bring clarity to laws addressing sex discrimination. It defines specific terms like ""male,"" ""female,"" ""man,"" and ""woman"" based on reproductive biological characteristics, emphasizing that while men and women are legally equal, they are not physically identical. The bill requires all state agencies, school districts, and public institutions collecting vital statistics to categorize individuals as either male or female, with provisions for marking ""unknown"" in cases where sex cannot be medically determined. The legislation prohibits discrimination based on sex while allowing for separate single-sex spaces when biological differences, privacy, safety, or fairness are relevant. Importantly, the bill recognizes individuals with differences in sex development (DSDs or intersex conditions) and mandates their accommodation under state and federal law. The definitions and provisions are intended to protect women's rights, maintain privacy in sex-specific spaces, and provide consistent legal interpretation across various contexts. The bill is set to become effective on October 1, 2025, and includes a severability clause to ensure that if any part of the act is found invalid, the remaining provisions will still stand.","Bill","Government Affairs, Health and Social Services","Forbids Unfair Treatment, Gender Identity Established, Point Produces Ova, Point Produces Sperm, Services Specifically Provided, Additional Data Points, Collected Data Set, Includes Includes Lands, Common Sex-Based Words, Means Judicial Circuit","Enacted","02/13/2025","8","April Weaver (R)*, Lance Bell (R), Steve Livingston (R), Clyde Chambliss (R), Garlan Gudger (R), David Sessions (R), Keith Kelley (R), Will Barfoot (R)","Signed/Enacted/Adopted","29","3","78","02/05/2025","02/12/2025","","Support"

The bill expands existing religious nondiscrimination statutes to explicitly prohibit government discrimination against religious organizations, individuals, and students based on their sincerely held religious beliefs. It defines new terms like ""belief about biological sex or marriage"" and provides protections for individuals in various contexts, including professional licensing, education, and workplace settings. The law prevents state government from taking discriminatory actions against people who decline to provide services, maintain separate facilities, or participate in activities that conflict with their religious beliefs about marriage or biological sex. It also allows government employees to seek recusal from performing marriage-related duties if those duties conflict with their religious beliefs, with safeguards to ensure constitutional rights are not unduly burdened. The bill requires that any restrictions on religious beliefs must meet a high legal standard, being essential to further a compelling governmental interest and using the least restrictive means possible. Overall, the legislation aims to protect religious freedom and prevent government-based discrimination against individuals and organizations with traditional religious views about marriage and gender.","Bill","Justice","Compelling Governmental Interest, Vehicle Service Rentals, Wedding Venue Rentals, Disc Jockey Services, Expressive Conduct Occurs, Similar Marriage-Related Services, Governmental Entity Due, Performing Work Duties, Similar Marriage-Related Goods, Expressive Conduct Based","Notification that HB1615 is now Act 677","04/16/2025","13","Robin Lundstrum (R)*, Gary Stubblefield (R)*, Howard Beaty (R), Alyssa Brown (R), Rebecca Burkes (R), Joey Carr (R), Brad Hall (R), Jack Ladyman (R), Wayne Long (R), Mindy McAlindon (R), Ryan Rose (R), Randy Torres (R), Steve Unger (R)","Signed/Enacted/Adopted","48","2","71","02/27/2025","04/21/2025","","Support"

Specifically, if a student requests in writing, the school must offer alternatives like single-occupancy restrooms or employee facilities, but cannot allow the student to use facilities designated for the opposite sex while others are present. The bill creates legal mechanisms for students to take action if their accommodation requests are denied, allowing them to sue the school for monetary damages related to psychological, emotional, or physical harm. The legislation defines ""sex"" as a person's biological sex at birth and provides clear definitions for changing facilities and restrooms. Students who successfully sue the school are entitled to recover attorney fees and costs, and have two years from the alleged violation to file a claim. The bill also preserves existing accommodations for students with disabilities and young children needing physical assistance.

The bill prohibits employees and contractors from being required to use preferred pronouns that do not correspond to a person's biological sex, and prevents employers from taking adverse personnel actions against workers who hold religious, moral, or biology-based beliefs about gender. Additionally, the bill restricts employment forms from offering non-binary sex options and prohibits state-funded employers from mandating training or instruction related to sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Key provisions include prohibiting males from competing on female athletic teams, requiring separate sleeping arrangements by sex during school trips, and allowing single-sex teams based on competitive skill or contact sports. The bill provides mechanisms for enforcement, including allowing private causes of action for individuals who believe their rights have been violated, and requires vital statistics collectors to identify individuals as either male or female. Additionally, the bill replaces the term ""gender"" with ""sex"" throughout Georgia's legal code and includes legislative findings emphasizing the importance of biological sex distinctions.

The legislation asserts that males and females are legally equal but biologically different, and that these differences mean they are not interchangeable in all circumstances. The bill's purpose is to address what its authors see as inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives that potentially endanger women's rights and single-sex spaces.

The bill defines sex as an immutable biological classification of male or female based on reproductive cell production at conception, and explicitly rejects the concept of gender identity as a legitimate basis for categorization. It requires all state agencies to use biological sex-based terminology in official documents, prohibit males from accessing female-designated spaces (such as prisons, shelters, and bathrooms), and remove any communications or policies that promote what the bill terms ""gender ideology."" The legislation mandates that state-issued identification documents reflect a person's biological sex, instructs state agencies to stop funding activities related to gender identity, and amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to remove ""gender-related identity"" from sexual orientation definitions. The bill's stated intent is to protect women's rights, safety, and dignity by maintaining clear biological distinctions between males and females, and it takes precedence over any conflicting state laws. Additionally, the bill repeals the Equitable Restrooms Act and requires state agencies to report on their implementation of these new guidelines within 120 days of the act's passage.","Bill","","Assess Grant Conditions, Assisted Reproductive Technologies, Domestic Abuse Shelters, Enforcing Sex-Based Distinctions, Entire American System, Large Reproductive Cell, Small Reproductive Cell, Central Management Services, Formal Pleading Filed, Joint Apprenticeship Committees","Referred to Assignments","02/06/2025","1","Andrew Chesney (R)*","In Committee","3","1","78","02/06/2025","02/06/2025","","Support"

The bill includes extensive legislative findings that challenge the medical and scientific basis for gender transition treatments for individuals under 18, citing concerns about long-term health risks, potential psychological impacts, and what the bill describes as insufficient scientific evidence supporting such interventions. Specifically, the bill would make it unprofessional conduct for medical doctors to prescribe hormones, perform surgeries, or even refer minors for such treatments related to gender dysphoria. The legislation defines key terms like ""biological sex"" and ""gender dysphoria"" and argues that the state has a moral duty to protect minors from what it characterizes as experimental and potentially harmful medical procedures. The bill would amend the Medical Practice Act to add violations of the Youth Health Protection Act as grounds for disciplinary action against medical professionals, potentially resulting in license suspension or other penalties. The underlying purpose, as stated in the bill, is to protect minors from medical interventions that could permanently alter their bodies before they are deemed capable of providing fully informed consent.","Bill","","Asd-Including Cognitive Deficits, Clin Endocrinol Metab, Deemed Sufficiently Rehabilitated, General Population Controls, Heather Brunskell-Evans Heather, Inherent Property Located, Lesbian Feminist Scholar, Love Princess Culture, Pbs Frontline Documentary, Ur Central Contention","Referred to Assignments","02/07/2025","1","Andrew Chesney (R)*","In Committee","3","1","142","02/07/2025","02/07/2025","","Support"

This bill increases the target foundation allowance to $10,250 per pupil and provides funding for targeted student interventions, particularly in schools with low academic performance. It establishes a new framework for supporting schools identified as ""support category buildings"" by requiring districts to allocate at least 10% of targeted student support dollars to interventions addressing student needs.

The bill allocates substantial funding for early childhood education, with $603,000,000 for Great Start Readiness Programs and provisions to expand access to preschool programs. It also provides significant resources for special education, career and technical education, and mental health support in schools. Additionally, the bill includes funding for student loan repayment programs for educators and grants to support school safety and mental health initiatives.

The legislation emphasizes accountability and transparency, requiring districts to provide detailed reporting on program expenditures, student outcomes, and interventions. It also includes provisions for cellular telephone policies in schools and creates new mechanisms for tracking and improving educational performance.

The overall intent is to increase parental involvement and control over minors' mental health, medical, and educational experiences by limiting professional and institutional discretion in providing services without explicit parental consent.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Autism Spectrum Disorder, External Genitalia Present, Grand Jury Subpoena, Nondisclosure Made Pursuant, Prevents Mandatory Reporting, Supportive Learning Environment, Testimonial Privilege Established, Prohibiting Parental Notification, Gender Ideology Occurring, Health Information Exchange","Referred to committee: Health","03/19/2025","16","Johnathan Newman (R)*, Gary Click (R), Rodney Creech (R), Levi Dean (R), Ron Ferguson (R), Sarah Fowler Arthur (R), Marilyn John (R), Roy Klopfenstein (R), Beth Lear (R), Ty Mathews (R), Melanie Miller (R), Diane Mullins (R), Kevin Ritter (R), Jodi Salvo (R), Josh Williams (R), Heidi Workman (R)","Introduced","2","1","81","03/12/2025","03/13/2025","","Support"

The bill requires that employees and contractors only address students by the name listed on their birth certificate or a derivative of that name, and only use pronouns consistent with the student's biological sex, unless they have written permission from the student's parent or guardian. Public school employees are prohibited from sharing their own preferred pronouns if those differ from their biological sex, requesting students' preferred pronouns, or penalizing students who do not use preferred names or pronouns. If a student requests accommodation related to gender identity, the school must immediately report this to the student's parent. The bill allows parents to bring a cause of action against schools that violate these provisions, potentially receiving injunctive relief and attorney's fees. Schools found in violation may have up to 10% of their state foundation aid withheld until they comply. The law also requires schools to develop policies promoting parental involvement, including notifying parents about substantial changes in student services, prohibiting school personnel from encouraging students to withhold information from parents, and establishing procedures for parental authorization of health care services.

If an objection is submitted regarding materials that are deemed pornographic, obscene, or sexually explicit, the materials must be removed within five school days and remain unavailable until the objection is resolved. The bill also modifies textbook selection processes, requiring review teams to consider specific criteria when recommending textbooks, such as maintaining that a person's biological sex is immutable and including culturally significant historical documents. Additionally, the bill expands local textbook committee membership to include more parent representatives and provides a mechanism for contesting the adoption of instructional materials through a formal hearing process.

The bill provides specific definitions for ten terms, including ""male"", ""female"", ""boy"", ""girl"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""father"", ""mother"", ""sex"", and ""gender identity"". Notably, the bill defines ""female"" as a person with a reproductive system capable of producing eggs, and ""male"" as a person with a reproductive system capable of producing sperm, both determined at the point of conception. The legislation explicitly states that ""gender identity"" will not be recognized by the federal government as a replacement for biological sex, describing it as a subjective sense of self disconnected from biological reality. By adding these definitions to Chapter 1 of Title 1 of the United States Code, the bill aims to create a uniform, biology-focused approach to understanding sex and gender in federal legislation, regulations, and interpretations across government agencies.","Bill","Justice","Consistent Biological Definitions, Immutable Biological Classification, Adult Human Female, Minor Human Female, Minor Human Male, Human  Beings, Biological  Function, Biological Function, Biological Reality, Establish Clear","Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.","03/26/2025","6","Roger Marshall (R)*, Bill Cassidy (R), Tim Sheehy (R), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R), Pete Ricketts (R), Jim Risch (R)","In Committee","1","1","29","03/27/2025","04/09/2025","Transgender Visibility Day","Support"

The legislation defines ""male"" and ""female"" based on reproductive biological characteristics, establishing that sex is determined at birth and that there are only two sexes, with accommodations for individuals with documented differences in sex development (DSD). The bill mandates that domestic violence shelters, public schools, state higher education institutions, and correctional facilities must provide separate sleeping quarters, restrooms, and changing areas exclusively for females and males, with provisions for reasonable accommodations for individuals who cannot use facilities matching their biological sex. The law aims to protect women's privacy and safety by preventing individuals of the opposite biological sex from accessing sex-specific spaces, with narrow exceptions for medical emergencies, law enforcement, maintenance, and child accompaniment. Additionally, the bill requires state agencies to collect sex-based data accurately to understand sex-specific differences in areas like crime, health, and economic trends. The legislation explicitly references constitutional protections for sex equality while emphasizing the biological differences between males and females, and includes a severability clause to ensure that if any part of the law is found unconstitutional, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.","Bill","Justice","Fourth Circuit Overrule, Important Government Interest, Residential Service Offered, Common Sex-Based Words, Sex-Based Protections Permitted, Designate Sleeping Quarters, Share Sleeping Quarters, Shared Sleeping Quarters, Shares Sleeping Quarters, Local Governmental Agency","On 2nd reading, House Calendar","03/03/2025","10","Roger Hanshaw (R)*, Kathie Crouse (R), Laura Kimble (R), Lori Dittman (R), Tresa Howell (R), Margitta Mazzocchi (R), Sarah Drennan (R), Erica Moore (R), Mickey Petitto (R), Lisa White (R)","In Committee","12","2","57","02/18/2025","02/25/2025","","Support"
