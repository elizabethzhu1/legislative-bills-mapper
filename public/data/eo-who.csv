The bill prohibits any requirements or mandates issued by these international organizations from being enforced or implemented by any state or local government entity, including state agencies, counties, cities, school districts, and other public bodies. Specifically, the bill prevents WHO or UN directives from being used as a basis for actions that would impose requirements such as mask mandates, vaccination protocols, or medical testing that conflict with Arkansas' state constitution and laws. Additionally, the bill prevents these international organizations from gathering public or private information about Arkansas citizens or residents. The legislation appears to be a preemptive measure to protect state sovereignty and limit the potential influence of international organizations in local governance and public health matters.","Bill","Health and Social Services","World Health Organization, Administrative Unit, Mandate Issued, Medical Testing, Private Information, Quasi-Public Entity, School District, School Hb, United Nations, Water District","Died in House Committee at Sine Die adjournment.","05/05/2025","8","Cameron Cooper (R)*, Clint Penzo (R)*, Mary Bentley (R), Alyssa Brown (R), Rebecca Burkes (R), Hope Duke (R), Wayne Long (R), Robin Lundstrum (R)","Dead","24","1","20","03/13/2025","03/13/2025","","support"

The bill removes previous language that allowed such policies to be implemented through rules or executive orders issued by the Governor. By eliminating the reference to executive orders and gubernatorial rules, the bill appears to create a more restrictive framework for how international health organization policies can be adopted in Florida, requiring explicit statutory authorization. This change would require state legislators to provide specific legal permission before any governmental entity or educational institution could implement policies recommended by international health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO). The bill is set to take effect on July 1, 2025, giving state agencies and institutions time to adjust to the new requirements.","Bill","Health and Social Services","International Health Organization, Executive Order Issued, Public Health Policies, Executive Order, Educational Institution, Governmental Entity, Policies Provided, Provision Authorizing, Entities & Institutions, Policies","Indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration","05/03/2025","4","Ryan Chamberlin (R)*, Monique Miller (R)*, Kim Kendall (R), Susan Plasencia (R)","In Committee","7","1","12","01/24/2025","01/24/2025","","support"

The bill removes previous language that allowed such policies to be adopted if authorized under state law, rule, or executive order issued by the Governor. By eliminating any potential pathways for implementing international health organization guidelines, the legislation appears to be aimed at preventing local and state government bodies and educational institutions from following health recommendations from global entities like the World Health Organization (WHO).

The bill removes previous language that allowed such policies to be adopted if authorized by state law, rule, or executive order from the Governor. By eliminating any exceptions, the legislation creates a blanket ban on following international health organization guidelines, regardless of their origin or potential merit. This means that state and local government agencies, as well as educational institutions in Florida, would be legally prevented from implementing health policies recommended by international bodies, potentially limiting their ability to respond to global health emergencies or adopt widely recognized public health best practices.

The legislation adds new sections to both the local government and state government codes, effectively blocking any potential enforcement of WHO or UN directives at the state, county, municipal, or local authority levels. By adding these provisions to Titles 36 and 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, the bill aims to establish a clear legal barrier against what its proponents likely view as potential overreach by international organizations. The bill would become effective upon the Governor's approval or by becoming law without such approval, and it includes a clause that repeals any existing laws that might conflict with its provisions. This legislation appears to be a preemptive measure to assert state sovereignty and limit the influence of international organizations within Georgia's governmental structures.","Bill","Agriculture and Natural Resources","World Health Organization, Consolidated Government, Governmental Entities, International Organizations, Local Board, Local Government, Municipal Corporations, Official Code, Related Matters, United Nations","House Natural Resources And Environment Subcommittee On Resource Management (upon Adjournment) (15:30:00 3/3/2025 415 CLOB)","03/03/2025","5","John Corbett (R)*, James Burchett (R)*, Jason Ridley (R)*, Trey Rhodes (R)*, Chas Cannon (R)*","Introduced","5","1","34","02/21/2025","02/22/2025","",""

Specifically, the bill declares that the WHO, which is a specialized agency of the United Nations governed by the World Health Assembly, shall have no jurisdiction or control over any aspect of Idaho's government, including its health-related agencies, departments, or functions. The legislation explicitly states that Idaho citizens will not be subject to any WHO terms, conditions, rules, regulations, or initiatives, even if they were previously agreed upon by the federal government. The bill includes an emergency clause, making it effective from July 1, 2025, which suggests the legislators view this as an urgent matter of state sovereignty and public health policy.

The bill prohibits state agencies, departments, boards, commissions, municipalities, and other political subdivisions from implementing or enforcing any directives from these organizations. By introducing this legislation, Kansas seeks to assert its state sovereignty and limit the potential influence of international bodies on local governance and policy-making.

Specifically, the bill creates a new section in Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) Chapter 211 that explicitly bars the state health agency from adopting any regulations based on WHO directives. Additionally, the bill amends the existing penalties statute (KRS 211.990) to specify that any violation of this new prohibition would be classified as a Class D felony, which in Kentucky typically carries a potential prison sentence of 1-5 years. The bill appears to be aimed at preventing state health authorities from adopting international health guidelines or recommendations, potentially limiting the state's ability to implement WHO-suggested public health measures.

The key provision is that any mandate from such external entities would first need to be voted on and passed as legislation by the Mississippi Legislature before the state would recognize or implement it. This means that international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), NATO, or international financial institutions would not have direct authority to impose rules or directives on Mississippi without going through the state's legislative process.

The legislation appears to be a preemptive measure to protect state and local property rights from what legislators may perceive as potential overreach by international organizations, particularly the UN.

Third, the bill creates a legal mechanism that allows individuals to bring claims against counties, cities, towns, school districts, and other local government or quasi-public entities if they create or enforce policies based on claims from the WHO, UN, or WEF.

Additionally, the bill provides more specific guidelines for how and when emergency declarations can be made, extended, or terminated, with an emphasis on legislative oversight and limiting prolonged emergency powers.

By enacting this legislation, Wyoming would essentially nullify federal and international health organization recommendations related to COVID-19 prevention measures, preventing state and local authorities from implementing such guidelines.","Bill","","Medical Testing Requirements, Nongovernmental Health Organizations, Prohibiting Health Mandates, World Health Organization, Health Organizations, Health Mandates-Cdc, Public Health, Disease Control, Variant Thereof, Guidance Provided","Did not Consider for Introduction","02/03/2025","12","Abby Angelos (R)*, Gary Brown (R)*, Paul Hoeft (R)*, Stephen Johnson (R)*, Thomas Kelly (R)*, Ann Lucas (R)*, Darin McCann (R)*, Clarence Styvar (R)*, Jacob Wasserburger (R)*, Nina Webber (R)*, Robert Wharff (R)*, Laura Taliaferro Pearson (R)*","Dead","3","1","29","01/09/2025","01/09/2025","",""
