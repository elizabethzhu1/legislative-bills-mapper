The bill defines ""castration, sterilization, or mutilation"" as a broad range of medical procedures including surgeries like mastectomies, hysterectomies, and various gender-affirming treatments, as well as prescription drugs that could affect fertility or puberty. The legislation allows civil lawsuits against anyone who causes or contributes to social transitioning or these medical procedures for minors, with potential damages ranging from $10,000 to $10 million. Plaintiffs can sue up to 15 years after the incident and may recover nominal, compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages, plus attorney's fees. The bill explicitly prohibits state officials from directly enforcing the law and provides robust legal immunity for state actors challenging the law. Notably, the bill includes exceptions for medically necessary treatments for individuals with genetic disorders of sex development and allows continuation of treatments begun before June 1, 2025, under specific counseling conditions. The law is designed to be applied extraterritorially and includes a severability clause to ensure that if any part of the law is found invalid, the rest can remain in effect.","Bill","Justice","Adverse Consequence Hb, Exhaust Administrative Remedies, Maximum Extent Permitted, Mental Health Counseling, Nonmutual Issue Preclusion, Sexual Dysfunction Results, Delay Normal Puberty, Diseased Body Part, Minor Attended Twelve, Nonmutual Claim Preclusion","House Judiciary Committee (10:00:00 4/1/2025 Room 149)","04/01/2025","2","Mary Bentley (R)*, Alan Clark (R)*","In Committee","18","1","62","03/04/2025","03/04/2025","","support"

Under the bill, healthcare and mental health professionals who perform these interventions on minors can be held liable for any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injuries resulting from the treatment. Minors or their representatives can file civil actions up to 15 years after the minor turns 18, seeking declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The bill establishes a ""safe harbor"" defense that requires extensive documentation, including two years of consistent gender identification, multiple professional certifications, and detailed informed consent that includes a lengthy warning statement about potential risks and long-term consequences of such interventions. The consent process must include specific verbal and written notices detailing potential medical risks, potential regret, fertility implications, and the lack of long-term research on these treatments for minors.","Bill","Justice","Advised ‘Great Caution, Conducted Systematic Reviews, Diminished Bone Density, Proportionally Spaced Typeface, Severe Liver Dysfunction, Mental Health Concern, Cross-Sex Hormone Therapy, Mental Health Professional, Subsequent Medical Visit, Coronary Artery Disease","Notification that HB1916 is now Act 979","04/22/2025","2","Mary Bentley (R)*, Alan Clark (R)*","Signed/Enacted/Adopted","23","2","67","03/31/2025","04/22/2025","","support"

Specifically, the bill mandates that any healthcare professional who performs a gender transition procedure on a minor is personally liable for all costs associated with future detransition procedures within 25 years of the initial treatment. The bill allows individuals who undergo a detransition procedure to file civil lawsuits against the original healthcare provider before turning 26, seeking compensation for detransition costs and other damages. Additionally, healthcare providers are strictly liable for any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological harm resulting from gender transition treatments, and individuals can file lawsuits up to eight years after turning 18 or within four years of discovering an injury, whichever is later. The bill permits claims for various types of damages, including compensatory and punitive damages, and explicitly prohibits healthcare providers from obtaining contractual waivers of liability through legal agreements.

The bill defines these treatments as interventions that alter an individual's appearance to no longer correspond with their biological sex, and it introduces significant legal and professional consequences for healthcare providers who violate these restrictions. Healthcare professionals who perform such treatments on minors would be subject to a class 1 misdemeanor charge and potential disciplinary action from their professional regulatory board. The bill also prohibits the use of public funds, state tax monies, and federal funds passing through state treasuries from being used to pay for gender transition treatments or related training, effectively creating a comprehensive ban on such medical interventions for minors. Additionally, the bill allows individuals to bring legal claims for violations, with specific provisions for minors to file suits even years after turning 18, and mandates that prevailing parties in such legal actions can recover attorney fees.

The bill allows the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor to withhold consent for treatment, activity, or mental health-care service that is designed and intended to form the parent's child's conceptions of sex and gender or to treat gender dysphoria or gender nonconformity. The bill prohibits a law enforcement officer acting pursuant to an investigation, an employee, an agent of this state, or a political subdivision from encouraging a minor to withhold information from the minor's parent or from withholding information regarding a minor's physical or mental health from the minor's parent. The bill prohibits a person from being discriminated or retaliated against by a person who provides information regarding an act or omission that violates the requirements described in the bill. The bill prohibits the state from using state funds for the performance of, or in furtherance of, any medical procedure or medical treatment that furthers a minor's desire to present or appear in a manner that is inconsistent with the minor's sex.

Medical professionals who engage in these practices could face professional disciplinary action and civil penalties. The bill includes exceptions for minors with verified genetic disorders of sexual development and for treatments already in progress before the act's effective date. It also establishes strong parental rights provisions, requiring that parents or guardians be immediately notified if a minor exhibits signs of gender dysphoria and empowering them to withhold consent for gender-related treatments. The legislation provides whistleblower protections for individuals who report potential violations, prohibits the use of state funds for gender transition procedures, and allows civil remedies for individuals harmed by prohibited practices.

The legislation appears to be a response to concerns about potential state intervention in parental decisions regarding a child's gender identity or expression. By limiting the grounds for state agency action, the bill seeks to protect parents' rights to make child-rearing decisions without fear of losing custody or facing investigative measures based exclusively on this specific criterion.","Bill","Education","Raise Children Consistent, Manner Consistent, Adoptive Placement, Biological Sex, Child  Consistent, Child Consistent, General Statutes, Solely Related, Child Abuse, Prospective Guardian","Referred to Joint Committee on Children","01/22/2025","2","Anne Dauphinais (R)*, Mark Anderson (R)","In Committee","1","1","23","01/21/2025","01/21/2025","","unclear"

The bill includes several key provisions: it bans physicians from performing gender transition procedures or referring children for such procedures, with limited exceptions for children born with medically verified disorders of sex development or those facing imminent life-threatening conditions. The legislation also prohibits the use of public funds for gender transition procedures, prevents Delaware Medicaid from covering such treatments for children, and bars health insurance plans from reimbursing these services. The bill establishes enforcement mechanisms, allowing individuals to bring claims up to two years after an incident, with extended timeframes for children who were minors at the time of the procedure.

The bill defines ""mental health professionals"" broadly to include physicians, psychologists, social workers, therapists, counselors, and other licensed mental health practitioners. It specifically defines ""sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts"" as practices attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to alter behaviors, reduce same-gender attractions, or use shaming or traumatic techniques. The legislation prohibits such practices and stipulates that violations will be considered unprofessional conduct subject to professional disciplinary action. Additionally, the bill requires the Department for Public Health and the Department for Behavioral Health to develop and distribute educational materials about the harmful effects of these change efforts to various professionals who work with youth. The bill explicitly allows counseling that provides support, understanding, and identity exploration, as long as it does not aim to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.

This means that if a child is transitioning gender with parental support, child protection services would be required to remove the child from the home and place them in a protective facility. The bill uses the term ""GER transition"" which appears to refer to gender transition, though the full meaning of the acronym is not specified. The changes would effectively treat parental support of a child's gender transition as a situation necessitating immediate child protective intervention, potentially allowing for the removal of the child from their home even when the parents are supportive of the child's gender identity.

Whereas, contemporary science recognizes that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender is part of the natural spectrum of human identity and is not a disease, disorder, or illness; and Whereas, the American Psychological Association convened a Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation (Task Force). The Task Force conducted a systemic review of peer-reviewed journal literature on sexual orientation change efforts and issued a report on those efforts in 2009. The Task Force concluded that sexual orientation change efforts can pose critical health risks to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, including confusion, depression, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, shame, social withdrawal, suicidality, substance abuse, stress, disappointment, self-blame, decreased self-esteem and authenticity to others, increased self-hatred, hostility and blame toward parents, feelings of anger and betrayal, loss of friends and potential romantic partners, problems in sexual and emotional intimacy, sexual dysfunction, high-risk sexual behaviors, a feeling of being dehumanized and untrue to self, a loss of faith, and a sense of having wasted time and resources; and Whereas, in 2009, the American Psychological Association issued a resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts, stating: ""[T]he [American Psychological Association] advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support, and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth.""; and Whereas, the American Psychiatric Association published a position statement in March of 2000 in which it stated the following: ""Psychotherapeutic modalities to convert or 'repair' homosexuality are based on developmental theories whose scientific validity is questionable. Furthermore, anecdotal reports of 'cures' are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm. In the last four decades, 'reparative' therapists have not produced any rigorous scientific research to substantiate their claims of cure. Until there is such research available, [the American Psychiatric Association] recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals' sexual orientation, keeping in mind the medical dictum to first, do no harm."" ""The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many patients who have undergone reparative therapy relate that they were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction. The possibility that the person might achieve happiness and satisfying interpersonal relationships as a gay man or lesbian is not presented, nor are alternative approaches to dealing with the effects of societal stigmatization discussed."" ""Therefore, the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his or her sexual homosexual orientation.""; and Whereas, in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association expanded on that position, stating: ""The American Psychiatric Association does not believe that same-sex orientation should or needs to be changed, and efforts to do so represent a significant risk of harm by subjecting individuals to forms of treatment which have not been scientifically validated and by undermining self-esteem when sexual orientation fails to change. No credible evidence exists that any mental health intervention can reliably and safely change sexual orientation; nor, from a mental health perspective does sexual orientation need to be changed.""; and Whereas, in 1993, the American Academy of Pediatrics published an article in its journal, Pediatrics, stating: ""Therapy directed at specifically changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.""; and Whereas, in 1994, the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs prepared a report, stating: ""Aversion therapy (a behavioral or medical intervention which pairs unwanted behavior, in this case, homosexual behavior, with unpleasant sensations or aversive consequences) is no longer recommended for gay men and lesbians. Through psychotherapy, gay men and lesbians can become comfortable with their sexual orientation and understand the societal response to it.""; and Whereas, the National Association of Social Workers prepared a 1997 policy statement, stating: ""Social stigmatization of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people is widespread and is a primary motivating factor in leading some people to seek sexual orientation changes. Sexual orientation conversion therapies assume that homosexual orientation is both pathological and freely chosen. No data demonstrates that reparative or conversion therapies are effective, and, in fact, they may be harmful.""; and Whereas, the American Counseling Association Governing Council issued a position statement in April of 1999, stating: ""We oppose 'the promotion of ""reparative therapy"" as a ""cure"" for individuals who are homosexual.'""; and Whereas, in 2014, the American School Counselor Association issued a position statement, stating: ""It is not the role of the professional school counselor to attempt to change a student's sexual orientation or gender identity. Professional school counselors do not support efforts by licensed mental health professionals to change a student's sexual orientation or gender as these practices have been proven ineffective and harmful.""; and Whereas, the American Psychoanalytic Association issued a position statement in June 2012 on attempts to change sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, stating: ""As with any societal prejudice, bias against individuals based on actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression negatively affect mental health, contributing to an enduring sense of stigma and pervasive self-criticism through the internalization of such prejudice."" The American Psychoanalytic Association further stated: ""Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful attempts to 'convert,' 'repair,' change or shift an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized attitudes.""; and Whereas, in 2012, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry published an article in its journal, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, stating: ""Clinicians should be aware that there is no evidence that sexual orientation can be altered through therapy, and that attempts to do so may be harmful. There is no empirical evidence adult homosexuality can be prevented if gender nonconforming children are influenced to be more gender conforming. Indeed, there is no medically valid basis for attempting to prevent homosexuality, which is not an illness. On the contrary, such efforts may encourage family rejection and undermine self-esteem, connectedness and caring, important protective factors against suicidal ideation and attempts. Given that there is no evidence that efforts to alter sexual orientation are effective, beneficial or necessary, and the possibility that they carry the risk of significant harm, such interventions are contraindicated.""; and Whereas, in 2012, the Pan American Health Organization, a regional office of the World Health Organization, issued a statement, stating: ""These supposed conversion therapies constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate human rights that are protected by international and regional agreements."" The organization also noted that reparative therapies ""lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people.""; and Whereas, in 2014, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) issued a statement, stating: ""[S]ame sex orientation is not a mental disorder and we oppose any 'reparative' or conversion therapy that seeks to 'change' or 'fix' a person's sexual orientation. AASECT does not believe that sexual orientation is something that needs to be 'fixed' or 'changed.' The rationale behind this position is the following: Reparative therapy (for minors, in particular) is often forced or nonconsensual. Reparative therapy has been proven harmful to minors. There is no scientific evidence supporting the success of these interventions. Reparative therapy is grounded in the idea that non-heterosexual orientation is 'disordered.' Reparative therapy has been shown to be a negative predictor of psychotherapeutic benefit.""; and Whereas, in 2015, the American College of Physicians issued a position paper, stating: ""The College opposes the use of 'conversion,' 'reorientation,' or 'reparative' therapy for the treatment of LGBT persons…Available research does not support the use of reparative therapy as an effective method in the treatment of LGBT persons. Evidence shows that the practice may actually cause emotional or physical harm to LGBT individuals, particularly adolescents or young persons.""; and Whereas, minors who experience family rejection based on their sexual orientation face especially serious health risks. In one study, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide, 5.9 times more likely to report high levels of depression, 3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs, and 3.4 times more likely to report having engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse compared with peers from families that reported no or low levels of family rejection. This is documented by Caitlin Ryan, et al., in their article entitled ""Family Rejection as a Predictor of Negative Health Outcomes in White and Latino Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults"" (2009) 123 Pediatrics 346; and Whereas, a 2018 study by the Family Acceptance Project found the following: ""Rates of attempted suicide by LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation were more than double (48%) the rate of LGBT young adults who reported no conversion experiences (22%). Suicide attempts nearly tripled for LGBT young people who reported both home-based efforts to change their sexual orientation by parents and intervention efforts by therapists and religious leaders (63%)."" ""High levels of depression more than doubled (33%) for young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation compared with those who reported no conversion experiences (16%), and more than tripled (52%) for LGBT young people who reported both home-based efforts to change their sexual orientation by parents and external sexual orientation change efforts by therapists and religious leaders."" ""Sexual orientation change experiences during adolescence by both parents and caregivers and externally by therapists and religious leaders were associated with lower young adult socioeconomic status, less educational attainment, and lower weekly income.""; and Whereas, North Carolina has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth, and in protecting its minors against exposure to serious harms caused by conversion therapy; Now, therefore,","This bill establishes the Mental Health Protection Act, which prohibits licensed mental health professionals from practicing conversion therapy (attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity) on minors under 18 or adults with disabilities. The bill defines conversion therapy as any practices or treatments aimed at changing sexual orientation, gender expression, or reducing romantic attractions to same-gender individuals. Specifically, the law applies to professionals including licensed counselors, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and pastoral counselors. Professionals who engage in conversion therapy will be subject to disciplinary action by their licensing entities, and the Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to initiate proceedings for violations. Additionally, the bill prohibits the use of state, municipal, or agency funds for conducting, referring for, or providing health benefits coverage for conversion therapy. The legislation is based on extensive research and statements from medical associations highlighting the potential psychological harm of such practices, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth, including increased risks of depression, suicide, and other negative mental health outcomes.

As defined in the bill, ""gender-affirming care"" means care that focuses on a transgender person's physical, mental, and social health needs and well-being while confirming the person's gender identity, including but not limited to, psychological or psychiatric care, surgery, hormone replacement therapy, and other nonsurgical treatments intended to align certain physical aspects of a person's gender identity. Specifically, the bill amends P.L.2004, c.187 (C.2A:34-53 et seq.), the ""Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act"" to stipulate that: 1) the presence of the child in this State for the purpose of receiving gender-affirming health care is sufficient for a State court to have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination for a child, if the child and the child's parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant connection with this State other than mere physical presence (section 13 of P.L.2004, c.147 (C.2A:34-65)); 2) a court of this State has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this State and the child is unable to receive gender-affirming health care in the child's home state (section 16 of P.L.2004, c.147 (C. 2A:34-68)); 3) a court of this State is the appropriate forum to exercise jurisdiction in a child custody case when the law or policy of the other state that may take jurisdiction limits the ability of a parent to obtain gender-affirming health care for a child (section 19 of P.L.2004, c.147 (C.2A:34-71)); and 4) in making a determination about whether a court in this State can decline to exercise its jurisdiction over a child custody case, the court cannot consider the taking or keeping of the child from the person who has legal or physical custody or visitation rights as a factor weighing against a petitioner in the case, if there is evidence that taking or keeping the child was so that the child could receive gender-affirming health care (section 20 of P.L.2004, c.147 (C.2A:34-72)). The bill also prohibits the Governor from extraditing a person who: is found in this State; was not in the state making the demand for extradition at the time of the commission of the alleged crime and did not flee; and is charged in the state making the demand for extradition with providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care that is permitted under the laws of this State. Under the bill's provisions, an attorney or counselor at law who practices law in the State is prohibited from responding to any subpoena issued by another state or jurisdiction if the subpoena relates to a violation of that state's or jurisdiction's law against a person providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care that is permitted under the laws of this State. The bill also prohibits a State, county, or local law enforcement agency from: 1) knowingly making an, or participating in the, arrest of a person pursuant to an outstanding arrest warrant issued by another state or jurisdiction for a violation of that state's or jurisdiction's law against a person providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care that is permitted under the laws of this State; and 2) cooperating with, or responding to, an inquiry from another state or jurisdiction about a person providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care that is permitted under the laws of this State. Under the bill, any law or judicial ruling of another state or jurisdiction authorizing a state agency to remove a child from the care and custody of the child's parent or guardian as a result of the parent or guardian allowing the child to receive gender-affirming health care cannot be enforced by a court of this State. The bill's provisions bar a health care facility licensed pursuant to pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:3H-2 et seq.) and a health care professional licensed pursuant to Title 45 or Title 52 of the Revised Statutes from providing the medical records of any child seeking or receiving gender-affirming health care in furtherance of any interstate investigation or proceeding, based on another state's law, seeking to impose civil or criminal liability upon a person or entity for: 1) the provision, receipt, or seeking of, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about, the person providing gender-affirming health care to a child that is permitted under the laws of this State; or 2) assisting, advising, aiding, abetting, facilitating, soliciting, or conspiring with any person or entity providing, receiving, seeking, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about, the person providing gender-affirming health care to a child that is permitted under the laws of this State. A health care facility or health care professional would be required to provide the medical records of any child seeking or receiving gender-affirming health care in the furtherance of an investigation or proceeding if the conduct subject to potential liability under the investigation or proceeding would be subject to liability under New Jersey law if committed in New Jersey, or if the provision of such medical records is necessary for a person to engage in conduct otherwise prohibited by the bill in order to comply with a valid order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the person, or to comply with applicable provisions of State or federal law. As defined in the bill: ""person"" means an individual, any State, county, or local governmental entity or instrumentality, a, partnership, an association, a limited liability company, or a corporation.","This bill establishes certain protections for persons who provide, receive, or allow a child to receive gender-affirming health care.

The bill amends existing law to: 1) allow New Jersey courts to have jurisdiction over child custody cases if the child is present in the state to receive gender-affirming care; 2) permit New Jersey courts to exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction if a child cannot receive such care in their home state; 3) designate New Jersey as the appropriate forum for child custody cases where another state's law limits access to gender-affirming care; and 4) prohibit consideration of taking a child for gender-affirming care as a factor against the petitioner in a custody case. The bill also prohibits the governor from extraditing someone charged in another state for providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming care permitted in New Jersey, and bars New Jersey law enforcement and attorneys from cooperating with out-of-state investigations or subpoenas related to such care.

The bill further defines a ""surgery required to address an immediate risk of physical harm"" to means a surgery: to remove tissue that poses a heightened clinical risk of malignancy relative to that of the general population; to allow urine to exit the body, to treat urinary incontinence, or to make a minimally invasive adjustment to urinary function in order to decrease a risk of infection or renal complication in a patient whose current urinary function puts them at a demonstrated clinical risk of infection or renal complication; thatis required to treat complications of a previous surgery and cannot be delayed without increasing physical health risks to the patient; or that is necessary to preserve life in the event of a medical emergency, except that psychological, psychosocial, or social factors shall not be the basis for determining whether the surgery is necessary to preserve an individual's life.

(3) The vast majority of minors who express distress in identifying with their biological sex eventually come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood.

It also bans prescribing puberty-blocking drugs, hormone treatments that could induce infertility, and removing healthy body parts. Additionally, the bill makes it illegal for non-physician mental health professionals to provide gender-affirming therapy or counseling to children intended to affirm a gender different from their biological sex. The legislation further prohibits healthcare professionals from referring children to out-of-state practitioners for treatments that would be considered illegal if performed in Texas. Violations of these provisions are classified as state jail felonies, which are criminal offenses that typically carry potential imprisonment and fines. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, giving healthcare providers and institutions time to adapt to the new legal requirements. This legislation represents a significant legal intervention in pediatric gender-related healthcare, restricting medical and therapeutic approaches for transgender and gender-questioning youth.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Diseased Body Part, Creating Criminal Offenses, Delay Normal Puberty, Treat Gender Dysphoria, Health Care Provider, Blocking Prescription Drugs, Gender Reassignment Procedures, Provide Health Care, Prescription Drugs, Reassignment Procedures","Referred to Public Health","03/21/2025","1","Tony Tinderholt (R)*","In Committee","3","1","47","02/26/2025","02/26/2025","","support"

For public schools, if a violation is found, the school could have its state funding withheld. For health care facilities, employees who violate the prohibition could face civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation and potential loss of professional licenses. The bill applies to both traditional public schools and open-enrollment charter schools, and extends to all governmental entities. Employees would receive a formal warning for a first violation and could be terminated for subsequent violations.

The bill defines gender modification procedures broadly, including surgeries like castration, hysterectomy, and hormone treatments that alter biological sex characteristics. It introduces strict liability for health insurers and medical providers, meaning they can be held financially responsible for lifetime medical costs associated with these procedures. The legislation prohibits governmental entities from using public funds for such treatments and bars specific state health plans (including Medicaid and child health plans) from covering gender modification procedures. However, the bill provides exceptions for individuals born with verified genetic disorders of sex development or those who do not have typical sex chromosome structures. The bill creates new legal frameworks that impose significant financial risks on healthcare providers and insurers offering these treatments, effectively making it extremely challenging to access gender modification procedures in Texas. The provisions will take effect on September 1, 2025, and apply to health benefit plans and potential legal actions from that date forward. The legislative findings suggest the bill is motivated by concerns about potential financial motivations in the medical community and potential long-term health impacts of such procedures.","Bill","Government Affairs","Diseased Body Part, Health Care Facilities, Health Care Provider, Gender Modification Procedure, Gender Modification Procedures, Health Care Procedure, Health Benefit Plan, Public Money Sec, Basic Coverage Plan, Basic Plan","Referred to State Affairs","02/03/2025","1","Bob Hall (R)*","In Committee","4","1","74","11/12/2024","11/12/2024","","support"

The legislation defines key terms like ""biological sex"" and ""gender transition"" and establishes strict limitations on medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. While the bill previously allowed hormone therapy under certain conditions—such as diagnoses from multiple medical professionals, written consent from parents and physicians, and a determination that treatment was medically necessary to prevent self-harm—it now categorically bans hormone blockers for minors in all circumstances. The bill applies to both medical doctors and osteopathic physicians and is set to take effect on January 1, 2024. The legislation maintains exceptions for medical treatments related to disorders of sex development, treating medical complications, or addressing imminent health risks, but explicitly removes the option of hormonal interventions for gender transition or management of gender dysphoria in individuals under 18.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Adolescent Medicine Specialist, Delay Normal Puberty, External Genitalia Present, Lowest Titratable Dosage, Major Bodily Function, Mental Health Provider, Mental Health Providers, Puberty Blocking Medication, Remove Hormone Therapy, Gender Altering Medication","To House Health and Human Resources","02/17/2025","10","Kathie Crouse (R)*, Sarah Drennan (R), Chuck Horst (R), Lisa White (R), Eric Brooks (R), Mike Hornby (R), Mark Dean (R), Michael Amos (R), Mickey Petitto (R), Marshall Clay (R)","In Committee","4","1","48","02/17/2025","02/17/2025","","support"

Specifically, the legislation prohibits healthcare professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice registered nurses, from providing gender-altering medication or gender reassignment surgery to individuals under 18 years of age.
