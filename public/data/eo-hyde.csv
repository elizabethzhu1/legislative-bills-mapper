The legislation defines contraception broadly as any action to prevent pregnancy, and includes a wide range of contraceptive methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as oral contraceptives, IUDs, emergency contraceptives, condoms, and other medical devices or methods. The bill guarantees that individuals in Alabama have the right to obtain contraceptives and that healthcare providers have the right to dispense them, and it prohibits state departments, agencies, and political subdivisions from implementing any laws or policies that would restrict or impede access to contraception. The bill also provides legal mechanisms for enforcement, allowing the Attorney General or affected healthcare providers to file civil actions against entities that violate these provisions, with specific defenses available only if an entity can prove a restriction significantly advances safety or is applied equally to medically similar products. Healthcare providers can bring actions on their own behalf or on behalf of patients, and the bill includes a provision that such legal challenges must meet a ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard. The law is set to take effect on October 1, 2025, and aims to comprehensively protect contraceptive access in the state.","Bill","Justice","Medically Similar Drugs, Pharmacist Licensed Pursuant, Service Licensed Pursuant, Health Care Institution, Health Care Provider, Health Care Providers, Providing Health Care, Reproductive Health Service, Hormonal Contraceptive Implants, Policy Significantly Advances","Pending Senate Judiciary","02/04/2025","1","Merika Coleman (D)*","In Committee","3","1","20","11/20/2024","11/19/2024","",""

Wade Supreme Court decision. The bill, titled the ""Restore Roe Act,"" would essentially eliminate numerous existing state laws that severely limit or criminalize abortion, including the Arkansas Human Life Protection Act, the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection Act, and multiple other subchapters that imposed strict restrictions on abortion procedures. Key provisions include allowing abortions up to the point of fetal viability, with limited exceptions after viability for the health or life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest involving a minor. The bill removes criminal penalties for performing abortions, eliminates mandatory waiting periods and counseling requirements, repeals reporting requirements that could potentially identify patients, and removes restrictions on abortion methods and medication. By repealing these existing laws, the bill seeks to return Arkansas's abortion regulations to a framework similar to what existed before the overturning of Roe v. Wade, prioritizing women's reproductive autonomy and medical decision-making.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Specialty Nurses Focused, Uniform Resource Locator, Normal Cell Growth, Geographically Indexed Names, Achieve Administrative Convenience, Federally Funded Benefits, Advanced Medical Technology, Guardian Ad Litem, Unforeseen Complication Arises, Perinatal Palliative Care","Died in House Committee at Sine Die adjournment.","05/05/2025","1","Andrew Collins (D)*","Dead","59","1","265","11/20/2024","11/20/2024","",""

The legislation introduces a detailed definition of ""medical emergency"" that requires physicians to use ""reasonable medical judgment"" when determining if a pregnancy termination is necessary to preserve a woman's life. The bill specifically clarifies that a medical emergency does not include conditions where alternative treatments can sustain the woman's life without ending the pregnancy, psychological or emotional conditions, or speculative diagnoses about potential future harm. The bill also defines ""reasonable medical judgment"" as a medical decision that a prudent, qualified physician would make given the specific case and treatment possibilities. Additionally, the legislation changes language around physician protections, stating that it is ""not a violation"" (rather than an ""affirmative defense to prosecution"") if a licensed physician provides medical treatment to a pregnant woman that accidentally or unintentionally results in injury or death to an unborn child. The legislative findings emphasize the intent to provide guidance and ensure that physicians can appropriately treat medical emergencies while protecting both the mother's and unborn child's lives.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Major Bodily Function, Species Homo Sapiens, Irreversible Physical Impairment, Emergency Medical Procedures, Emergency Medical Situations, Reasonable Medical Judgement, Reasonable Medical Judgment, “Medical Emergency” Means, Medical Conditions Involved, Unintentional Physical Injury","Notification that HB1610 is now Act 387","03/20/2025","40","Robin Lundstrum (R)*, Jimmy Hickey (R)*, Brandon Achor (R), Mary Bentley (R), Alyssa Brown (R), Karilyn Brown (R), Matt Brown (R), Rebecca Burkes (R), Cindy Crawford (R), Bruce Cozart (R), Jimmy Gazaway (R), Zack Gramlich (R), Brad Hall (R), Lee Johnson (R), Jack Ladyman (R), Wayne Long (R), Julie Mayberry (R), John Maddox (R), Rick McClure (R), Richard McGrew (R), Jon Milligan (R), Chad Puryear (R), Marcus Richmond (R), Ryan Rose (R), Kendon Underwood (R), Johnny Rye (R), Randy Torres (R), Steve Unger (R), Carlton Wing (R), Jim Wooten (R), Stan Berry (R), Sonia Barker (R), Cameron Cooper (R), R.J.

The bill changes the language around abortion-related restrictions, removing the term ""nonfederally qualified"" and expanding the prohibition to include facilities that promote abortions, not just perform them. The legislation maintains a priority order for distributing public funds for family planning services, starting with state-owned health facilities, then hospitals, federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and primary health service providers. The bill allows the attorney general or county attorney to take legal action to enforce these restrictions, and any entity potentially impacted by funding reductions can also bring a lawsuit. Entities found to be in violation could face legal consequences, including potential recoupment of funds and mandatory attorney fees. The bill also updates definitions related to public monies, hospitals, health centers, and rural health clinics, and removes a previous definition of ""nonfederally qualified abortion.""

The bill mandates that a qualified physician must physically examine the patient, verify the pregnancy, determine the patient's blood type, and offer Rh testing if applicable. The physician must also provide detailed information about potential physical and psychological side effects of the abortion-inducing drug, including the possibility of seeing fetal remains. The bill requires physicians to document the pregnancy's gestational age and location, and be credentialed to manage potential complications, including having a signed agreement with an associated physician who can handle emergencies. Physicians must schedule a follow-up appointment 7-14 days after the drug administration to confirm complete termination and assess bleeding. The bill prohibits providing abortion-inducing drugs via mail or courier and establishes civil liability provisions that allow women, minors' parents/guardians, and in some cases, the father of the unborn child to sue for damages if the law is violated. The bill includes specific exceptions for cases involving sexual assault, domestic violence, or terminated parental rights. The legislation also includes confidentiality provisions for legal proceedings and emphasizes that it does not create a right to abortion.

The bill also mandates that policies covering outpatient health services must provide outpatient contraceptive services, which include consultations, examinations, procedures, and medical services related to preventing unintended pregnancies. Additionally, the legislation removes previous provisions that allowed religiously affiliated employers to opt out of contraceptive coverage based on religious beliefs. The bill applies to various types of insurance policies, including subscription contracts, health care services organizations, disability insurance, and blanket disability insurance, with the exception of individual non-group policies.

The bill allows donor banks to only recommend this step to recipients of donor gametes. Donor bank licensure renewal is extended from annually to once every 5 years. The requirement that the department investigate donor banks outside the state of Colorado is eliminated, and the fine for donor banks that are out of compliance is modified from an automatic $20,000 per-day fine to a fine to be determined by the state board of health.","This bill (titled the ""Reducing Barriers to Building Families Act"") aims to protect and streamline reproductive health care and in vitro fertilization (IVF) services in Colorado, particularly in response to concerns raised by a recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling. The bill establishes several key provisions: it affirms individuals' rights to make autonomous decisions about reproductive health, including using or destroying gametes and embryos; protects physicians' ability to provide reproductive health care; and prevents Colorado from allowing civil or criminal actions against individuals engaging in reproductive health services that might be prohibited in other states. The bill modifies existing laws regarding gamete donation by changing requirements for donor information collection, allowing donor banks to only recommend (not require) recipients to report live births, and extending donor bank licensure renewal from annually to every five years. Importantly, the bill emphasizes Colorado's commitment to being a progressive destination for assisted reproductive technologies, ensuring legal protections for donor-conceived children and potential parents. The legislation also removes some previous requirements for donor information maintenance and updates, while still encouraging transparency and medical history reporting. The bill's broader context is to protect reproductive healthcare access and maintain Colorado's reputation as a leading state for fertility treatments and family-building options.","Bill","Budget and Finance, Health and Social Services","Good Faith Effort, Good Faith Efforts, Likewise Safeguarded Due, Licensed Medical Provider, Conducting Sufficient Record-Keeping, Assisted Reproductive Procedures, Assisted Reproductive Technologies, Mental Health Evaluations, Cutting-Edge Medical Care, Make Autonomous Decisions","House Considered Senate Amendments - Result was to Concur - Repass","05/07/2025","28","Kyle Brown (D)*, Meg Froelich (D)*, Lisa Cutter (D)*, Lindsey Daugherty (D)*, Jennifer Bacon (D), Andrew Boesenecker (D), Chad Clifford (D), Lorena García (D), Sheila Lieder (D), Mandy Lindsay (D), Meghan Lukens (D), Javier Mabrey (D), Karen McCormick (D), Manny Rutinel (D), Emily Sirota (D), Rebekah Stewart (D), Tammy Story (D), Alex Valdez (D), Elizabeth Velasco (D), Jenny Willford (D), Steven Woodrow (D), Yara Zokaie (D), Iman Jodeh (D), Dafna Michaelson Jenet (D), Kyle Mullica (D), Tom Sullivan (D), Katie Wallace (D), Faith Winter (D)","Passed","44","5","125","02/12/2025","05/06/2025","",""

The legislation aims to protect reproductive healthcare as a fundamental personal right, free from governmental interference or potential criminal prosecution.","Bill","Justice","Return Receipt Requested, Show Proper Identification, Species Homo Sapiens, Suffering Severe Face, Entity Record Keeping, Approve Mercy Killing, Perinatal Death Due, Unemanicpated Minor Consents, Detectable Human Heartbeat, Population Based Determinations","Senate Read and Referred","02/26/2025","23","Sally Harrell (D)*, Kenya Wicks (D)*, Harold Jones (D)*, Kim Jackson (D)*, Tonya Anderson (D)*, Nan Orrock (D)*, RaShaun Kemp (D)*, Sonya Halpern (D)*, Donzella James (D)*, Nikki Merritt (D)*, Freddie Sims (D)*, Emanuel Jones (D)*, Nabilah Islam Parkes (D)*, Derek Mallow (D)*, Josh McLaurin (D)*, Elena Parent (D)*, David Lucas (D)*, Sheikh Rahman (D)*, Ed Harbison (D)*, Gail Davenport (D)*, Doc Rhett (D)*, Randal Mangham (D)*, Jason Esteves (D)*","In Committee","2","1","177","02/24/2025","02/25/2025","",""

(HD1)","This bill requires the Hawaii Department of Health to stockpile at least a one-year supply of mifepristone, a medication commonly used for medication-based abortions. The legislation is rooted in Hawaii's long-standing commitment to protecting individual privacy and reproductive rights, particularly in response to the 2022 Supreme Court Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. The bill highlights that abortion care is currently only available on Maui and Oahu, with 63% of abortions completed through oral medication, and notes that other states like California and New York have already implemented similar medication stockpiling strategies. To support this effort, the bill appropriates $75,000 in state general revenues for fiscal year 2025-2026 specifically for purchasing mifepristone, which has a five-year shelf life. The legislation emphasizes Hawaii's constitutional commitment to individual rights, privacy, and bodily autonomy, and aims to proactively ensure continued access to reproductive healthcare services within the state, regardless of potential federal or interstate restrictions.","Bill","Budget and Finance, Health and Social Services","Legal Landscape Threaten, Severely Restricting Access, Shifting Legal Landscape, Suffer Temporary Disruption, Stockpiled Abortifacient Medications, Bodily Autonomy Independently, Dobbs Overrules Roe, Stockpile Medication Required, Stockpile Abortifacient Medications, Mifepristone Supply Chain","Passed Second Reading as amended in HD 1 and referred to the committee(s) on FIN with Representative(s) Reyes Oda voting aye with reservations; Representative(s) Alcos, Garcia, Matsumoto, Muraoka, Pierick, Shimizu voting no (6) and Representative(s) Cochran, Sayama, Ward excused (3).","02/12/2025","9","Terez Amato (D)*, Della Belatti (D)*, Tina Grandinetti (D)*, Kim Iwamoto (D)*, Kirstin Kahaloa (D)*, Jeanné Kapela (D)*, Amy Perruso (D)*, Mahina Poepoe (D)*, Gregg Takayama (D)*","In Committee","8","2","52","01/21/2025","02/11/2025","",""
"https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1850511","IA","HF666","A bill for an act relating to the Iowa human life protection Act, providing for civil actions and civil penalties, and including effective date provisions.","This bill creates the Iowa human life protection Act in new Code chapter 146F, and provides for civil actions and civil penalties. The bill includes findings relating to human life and abortion. New Code section 146F.2 provides definitions used in the new Code chapter including “abortion fund”, “abortion-inducing drug”, “abortion provider”, “affiliate”, “aiding or abetting”, “attempt” or “attempts”, “elective abortion”, “fertilization”, “governmental entity”, “information content provider”, “interactive computer service”, “major bodily function”, “medical emergency”, “medically indicated separation procedure”, “perform”, “performance”, “performed”, “performs”, or “performing” relative to an elective abortion, “person”, “policy”, “political subdivision”, “pregnant”, “taxpayer resource transaction”, “unborn child”, and “woman” or “women”. New Code section 146F.3 prohibits a person from knowingly using, employing, or administering any drug, instrument, device, means, or procedure upon a pregnant woman with the specific intent to cause an elective abortion, or from aiding or abetting such conduct. The prohibition applies if any portion of the prohibited conduct or elective abortion occurs in the state or within the jurisdiction of the state. The requirements of new Code section 146F.3 shall be enforced exclusively through the qui tam actions described in the bill; direct or indirect enforcement shall not be taken or threatened; and a violation of the Code section shall not be used to justify or trigger the enforcement of any other law or any type of adverse consequence under any other law, except as provided in the provisions of the bill relating to qui tam actions. However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation and that would remain prohibited by such other law or regulation. The prohibition does not apply to speech or conduct protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States; conduct the state is forbidden to regulate under federal law or the Constitution of the United States; the provision of basic public services by a governmental entity or a common carrier to an abortion provider, an abortion fund, or an affiliate of an abortion provider or abortion fund in the same manner those services are provided to the general public; or conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that conduct would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity. New Code section 146F.4 provides for liability for wrongful death and personal injuries related to an elective abortion. The Code section provides that a person who violates new Code section 146F.3 shall be subject to joint and several liability for the wrongful death of an unborn child who dies from the elective abortion; and strict, and joint and several liability for the wrongful death of a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who dies from the elective abortion and any personal injuries suffered by an unborn child or pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman from the elective abortion. A surviving parent of an unborn child who was aborted in violation of the bill may maintain an action for wrongful death against a person who knowingly violated the bill resulting in the wrongful death of the unborn child. The bill prohibits a lawsuit under new Code section 146E.4 against and by certain people including: against a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to abort the pregnant woman’s unborn child; against a person that acted at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the imposition of liability would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; by a person who through an act of sexual assault or incest impregnated the pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman; and against a provider or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law. A prevailing plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages of not less than $100,000. Under new Code section 146F.4, if a plaintiff brings suit in response to a drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify the specific manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that caused the death or injury, liability is apportioned among all manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to each manufacturer’s share of the market for abortion-inducing drugs. A person may bring an action no later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the right to sue is void as against public policy and shall not be enforceable in any court. The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. New Code section 146F.5 relates to prohibitions related to abortion-inducing drugs and qui tam enforcement. The Code section provides that it is unlawful for a person to manufacture, possess, or distribute abortion-inducing drugs in the state; mail, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs in any manner to or from a person or location in the state; or engage in any conduct that constitutes aiding and abetting the manufacture, possession, distribution, mailing, transporting, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The bill does not prohibit constitutionally protected speech or conduct; conduct that the state is forbidden to regulate under federal law or the Constitution of the United States; conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that conduct would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborts or seeks to abort the woman’s unborn child; the manufacture, possession, distribution, mailing, transporting, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs for a purpose that does not include termination of a pregnancy; the possession of abortion-inducing drugs related to an effort to entrap persons that violate the Code section; or any of the conduct described under the section of the bill relating to interactive computer services. New Code section 146F.5 shall only be enforced as a qui tam action as provided under the bill and direct or indirect enforcement of the Code section shall not be taken or threatened. However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation, and that would remain prohibited by such other law or regulation. New Code section 146F.6 relates to liability for wrongful death and personal injuries related to the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The Code section provides that a person who manufactures, mails, distributes, transports, delivers, or provides abortion-inducing drugs; or who aids or abets the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs shall be strictly, and jointly and severally liable for the wrongful death of an unborn child or pregnant woman who dies from the use of abortion-inducing drugs, and for any personal injuries suffered by an unborn child or pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman from the use of abortion-inducing drugs. The surviving parents of an unborn child who was aborted in violation of the Code section of the bill relating to elective abortion prohibitions may maintain an action for wrongful death against a person who knowingly violated the Code section resulting in the wrongful death of the unborn child. New Code section 146F.6 prohibits a lawsuit from being brought against a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who used or sought to obtain abortion-inducing drugs to abort or attempt to abort her unborn child; against a person that acted at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the imposition of liability would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; by a person who, through an act of sexual assault or incest, impregnated the woman who used abortion-inducing drugs; or against a provider or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law. A prevailing plaintiff under new Code section 146E.6 is entitled to recover compensatory damages, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages of not less than $100,000. If a plaintiff brings suit in response to a drug-induced abortion and is unable to identify the specific manufacturer of the abortion-inducing drug that caused the death or injury, liability shall be apportioned among all manufacturers of abortion-inducing drugs in proportion to each manufacturer’s share of the market for abortion-inducing drugs. A person may bring an action no later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. Waiver of the right to sue is void as against public policy and shall not be enforceable in any court. It is an affirmative defense if a person sued under this Code section was unaware that the person was engaged in the conduct described in this Code section, and took every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person would not manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, provide, or aid or abet the manufacture, mailing, distribution, transportation, delivery, or provision of abortion-inducing drugs. The defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. New Code section 146F.7 provides for qui tam enforcement for certain violations under the bill. A person, other than a governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity, has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action against any person that violates any provision of new Code section 146F.3 (elective abortion prohibitions), 146F.4 (abortion-inducing drugs prohibitions), or 146F.14 (government contractors and grant recipients); or any person who intends to violate any provision of those Code sections. A civil action shall not be brought under the Code section against the pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman upon whom an elective abortion was performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced or against a pregnant woman who intends or who seeks an elective abortion in violation of the new Code chapter; against any person that performs, aids or abets, or attempts to perform or aid or abet an elective abortion at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if a prohibition on that elective abortion would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; against a common carrier that transports a pregnant woman to an abortion provider, if the common carrier is unaware that the pregnant woman intends to abort the pregnant woman’s unborn child; against a provider or user of an interactive computer service if such a lawsuit would be preempted by federal law; or by a person who, through an act of sexual assault or incest, impregnated a woman who is seeking an elective abortion or a person who acts in concert or participation with the person who impregnated the woman. An action shall be brought in the name of the person and of the state. A plaintiff who prevails in an action under this Code section shall be awarded injunctive relief, nominal and compensatory damages if the plaintiff has suffered injury or harm from the defendant’s conduct, civil penalties of not less than $10,000 for each violation, and court costs and reasonable attorney fees. A person may bring an action no later than six years from the date the cause of action accrues. It is an affirmative defense if a person sued was unaware that the person was engaged in the specified conduct and took every reasonable precaution to ensure that the person would not be in violation of the specified provisions of the bill. The Code section shall not be construed to impose liability on constitutionally protected speech or conduct. A court shall not award court costs or reasonable attorney fees to a defendant. A person bringing an action is entitled to receive 25 percent of the civil penalties recovered, with the remaining civil penalties paid to the state. The state is not liable for expenses that a person incurs in bringing an action. New Code section 146F.8 provides for qui tam enforcement for violations relating to interactive computer services. The Code section provides that a person, other than a governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity, has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action against a person that provides or maintains an interactive computer service that allows Iowa residents to access information or material that assists or facilitates efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; provides or maintains a platform for downloading any application or software for use on a computer or electronic device that is designed to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; or provides or maintains a platform that allows or enables those who provide or aid or abet elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs, to collect money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value in exchange for such services. An action under new Code section 146F.8 shall be brought in the name of the person and the state. A prevailing plaintiff shall only be awarded declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages. Relief shall not be awarded if the action is brought in response to the exercise of state or federal constitutional rights that belong personally to the defendant; conduct taken at the behest of a federal agency, contractor, or employee that is carrying out duties under federal law, if the relief would violate the doctrine of preemption or intergovernmental immunity; or conduct taken by a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman who aborted or attempted to abort such woman’s unborn child, if such woman is the named defendant in the civil action. Under new Code section 146F.8, it is an affirmative defense if a person who sued was unaware that the person’s interactive computer service or platform was being used to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs; and upon discovering that the person’s interactive computer service or platform was being used to assist or facilitate such efforts, the person took prompt action to block access to any information, material, application, or software and to block those who provide or aid or abet elective abortions and those who manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs, from collecting money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value in exchange for such services through its interactive computer service or platform. The defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. A person who engages in the violative conduct shall not be held vicariously liable for any nominal, statutory, or compensatory damages incurred by another information content provider; held liable or legally responsible for the conduct of any publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider; or treated as the speaker or publisher of any information provided by another information content provider under any provision of state law. New Code section 146F.8 shall be enforced exclusively through the qui tam action and direct or indirect enforcement of this Code section shall not be taken or threatened. However, the Code section does not preclude or limit the enforcement of any other law or regulation against conduct that is independently prohibited by such other law or regulation, and that would remain prohibited by such other law or regulation in the absence of the Code section. Under new Code section 146F.8, a provider or user of an interactive computer service shall have absolute and nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account of an action taken to restrict access to or availability of information or material that assists or facilitates access to elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs, whether or not such information or material is constitutionally protected; an action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to information or material described in the Code section; or a denial of service to those who provide or aid or abet elective abortions, or those who manufacture, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, or provide abortion-inducing drugs. The state is not liable for expenses that a person incurs in bringing an action under the Code section. New Code section 146F.9 provides affirmative defenses for a defendant against whom an action is brought under new Code section 146F.6 (liability for wrongful death and personal injury —— abortion-inducing drugs), 146F.7 (qui tam enforcement for certain violations), or 146F.8 (qui tam enforcement —— interactive computer services). The defendant must prove the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Code section does not limit or preclude a defendant from asserting the unconstitutionality of any provision or application of state law as a defense or from asserting any other defense that might be available under any other source of law. A court shall not apply the law of another state or jurisdiction to any civil action brought under the specified Code sections, unless otherwise required by law. New Code section 146F.10 specifies the defenses that are not applicable to an action brought under Code section 146F.4 (liability for wrongful death and personal injury —— elective abortion), 146F.6, or 146F.7. New Code section 146F.11 includes venue provisions and provides that if an action is brought under new Code section 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8, the action shall not be transferred to a different venue without the written consent of all parties. New Code section 146F.12 includes provisions relating to personal jurisdiction, choice of law, and class action lawsuits. The Code section provides that the courts of this state shall have personal jurisdiction over any defendant sued under Code section 146F.4, 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8; Iowa law shall apply to these actions, and such civil actions shall not be litigated on behalf of a plaintiff class or a defendant class, and a court shall not certify a class in any civil action brought under these Code sections. New Code section 146F.13 provides protection from counter lawsuits by providing that when a lawsuit has been brought or a judgment entered against a person in any state or federal court in which the lawsuit or liability in whole or in part is based on that person’s decision or threat to bring an action under Code section 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8, that person may recover damages from any party that brought the action, obtained the judgment, or sought to enforce the judgment. Recoverable damages include compensatory damages; court costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney fees incurred in bringing an action to recover the costs; and additional statutory damages in an amount of not less than $100,000. New Code section 146F.14 relates to government contractors and grant recipients and qui tam libability. The Code section provides that a person that enters into a contract with a governmental entity or a subcontract with a contractor of a governmental entity, or that receives any grant or funding from a governmental entity shall not pay for, reimburse, or subsidize in any way the costs associated with an elective abortion including by providing coverage of elective abortions as an employee benefit; paying for, reimbursing, or subsidizing the travel costs associated with obtaining an elective abortion, or covering those costs as an employee benefit; donating or lending money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value to an abortion provider, abortion fund, or an affiliate of an abortion provider, either directly or by laundering the donation or loan through an intermediary; offering, providing, or lending money, digital currency, resources, or any other thing of value with the knowledge that the thing of value will be used to pay for, offset, or reimburse the costs of an elective abortion or the costs associated with procuring an elective abortion; performing or providing any type of work or service for an abortion provider, abortion fund, or an affiliate of an abortion provider, regardless of whether such work or service is done on a paid, contract, or volunteer basis, except for the provision of basic public services in the same manner as the governmental entity or common carrier provides the services to the general public; paying, offering to pay, or providing insurance that covers legal expenses, court judgments, or settlements of those who violate the abortion laws of the United States, or the abortion laws of any state, local, or foreign jurisdiction; or engaging in any conduct that would constitute aiding and abetting an elective abortion. Additionally, a person shall not enter into the specified contracts or receive any grant or funding from a governmental entity, unless the person certifies in writing that the person complies with the requirements. A person who violates this Code section is subject to qui tam liability as provided in new Code section 146F.7. New Code section 146F.15 relates to internet service providers. The Code section provides that an internet service provider that provides service in the state shall make all reasonable and technologically feasible efforts to block access to child pornography as defined in federal law and information or material that is intended to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs. A person who becomes aware that information or material described is accessible through internet service provided by an entity that provides internet service in the state may notify that internet service provider and request that the internet service provider block access to the information or material through any means specified in the bill. While direct or indirect enforcement shall not be taken or threatened by a governmental entity or by any officer or employee of a governmental entity, the state, its political subdivisions, and officers and employees of the state and its political subdivisions may ask or encourage internet service providers to comply with the provisions of the Code section. An internet service provider shall have absolute and nonwaivable immunity from liability or suit on account of an action taken as described in the Code section. If a lawsuit is brought or a judgment entered against an internet service provider in any state or federal court based on the internet service provider’s compliance with the Code section, the internet service provider may recover costs related to the action as well as compensatory damages and statutory damages of not less than $100,000. New Code section 146F.16 relates to internet service in publicly owned buildings, public libraries, school district locations, and institutions of higher education relative to access to certain information. A publicly owned building in the state that provides internet service shall be equipped to operate a technology protection measure with respect to each of the computers with internet access in the publicly owned building that protects against access through those computers to child pornography as defined in federal law and information or material that is intended to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain elective abortions or abortion-inducing drugs, including through interactive computer services. A person who becomes aware that information or material described in the Code section is accessible through internet service provided by a government-owned building, public library, school district location, or location of an institution of higher education governed by the state board of regents may notify an authority with control over the building and request that the authority block access to that information or material. The authority may disable a technology protection measure that blocks the information specified under subsection 1 to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes. New Code section 146F.17 relates to governmental entities and political subdivisions and prohibitions relating to elective abortion and taxpayer resource transactions. A political subdivision may enact and enforce ordinances regulating, restricting, or prohibiting elective abortion and conduct that aids or abets elective abortion. A provision of state law shall not be construed to limit a political subdivision from enacting or enforcing ordinances regulating, restricting, or prohibiting elective abortion and conduct that aids or abets elective abortion, unless it clearly and explicitly does so with specific reference to the Code section. The Code section also prohibits a governmental entity from entering into a taxpayer resource transaction with certain entities unless required to do so by federal law or as a condition of receiving federal funds. A person has standing to bring and may bring a qui tam action against any person that enacts, issues, enforces, or attempts to enforce any ordinance, order, rule, directive, requirement, or written or unwritten policy described in the Code section or that enters into a taxpayer resource transaction described in the Code section. An action under the Code section shall be brought in the name of the person and the state. A plaintiff who prevails in a qui tam action brought under the Code section shall recover and be granted declaratory and injunctive relief, nominal and compensatory damages if the plaintiff has suffered injury or harm from the defendant’s conduct, civil penalties in an amount of not less than $10,000 for each policy that violates the Code section and for each prohibited taxpayer resource transaction, and court costs and reasonable attorney fees. Sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, and official immunity are waived and abrogated in any lawsuit brought under the Code section and shall not be asserted as a defense. A person bringing an action under the Code section is entitled to receive 25 percent of the civil penalties recovered, with the remainder paid to the state. The state is not liable for expenses that a person incurs in bringing an action under the Code section. New Code section 146F.18 relates to persons qualified to perform services under the Medicaid program. The Code section provides that certain persons are not deemed persons qualified to perform the service or services as described in federal law under the Medicaid program. The state and its officers and employees have sovereign immunity in any lawsuit brought to restrain the state and its officers and employees from enforcing the Code section. An attorney representing the state, its political subdivisions, or any officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision shall not waive the immunity described in the Code section or take any action that would result in a waiver of that immunity, and any such action or purported waiver shall be a legal nullity and an ultra vires act. New Code section 146F.19 relates to the costs of lawsuits for injunctive or declaratory relief relating to restrictions on elective abortions. The bill provides that a person that seeks declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent certain persons from enforcing or bringing suit to enforce certain actions, is jointly and severally liable to pay the court costs and reasonable attorney fees of the prevailing party, including the court costs and reasonable attorney fees that the prevailing party incurs in the prevailing party’s efforts to recover such court costs and reasonable attorney fees. The Code section specifies what constitutes a prevailing party, limitations on the costs that may be recovered, allows for an action to recover the costs not later than three years from the date on which the dismissal or judgment becomes final on the conclusion of appellate review or from the time for seeking appellate review expires. The Code section provides the forum in which action may be brought and prohibits any contractual choice-of-forum provision. New Code section 146F.20 relates to immunity from suit and limits on state court jurisdiction. The state, its political subdivisions, an officer and employee of the state or a political subdivision shall have sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, and official immunity as described in the bill. Under new Code section 146F.20, any judicial relief issued by a court of this state that disregards the immunities conferred or the jurisdictional limitations specified shall be a legal nullity due to lack of jurisdiction, and shall not be enforced or obeyed by any officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision, judicial or otherwise. Any injunction, declaratory judgment, or writ issued by a court of this state that purports to restrain the state, its political subdivisions, an officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision, or any person from hearing, adjudicating, docketing, or filing a civil action brought under new Code section 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8, shall be a legal nullity and a violation of the due process clause and shall not be enforced or obeyed by any officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision, judicial or otherwise. Any officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision, judicial or otherwise, who issues, enforces, or obeys an injunction, declaratory judgment, or writ described shall be subject to suit by any person who is prevented from or delayed in bringing a civil action, and a plaintiff who prevails in such an action shall be awarded and recover injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages of not less than $100,000, and court costs and reasonable attorney fees. New Code section 146F.20 provides that a person who violates the provisions relating to immunities conferred or the jurisdictional limitations specified is prohibited from asserting and being entitled to any type of immunity defense, being indemnified for any award of damages or court costs and reasonable attorney fees entered against the person or for the costs of the person’s legal defense, and receiving or obtaining legal representation from the attorney general in any action brought under the Code section. Any person who sues and seeks any injunction, declaratory judgment, or writ that would restrain any person from hearing, adjudicating, docketing, or filing a civil action brought under new Code section 146F.6, 146F.7, or 146F.8 shall pay the court costs and reasonable attorney fees of the person sued. New Code section 146F.21 relates to the application of the Code chapter to pregnant women by providing that the Code chapter shall not be construed to subject a pregnant woman or formerly pregnant woman on whom an elective abortion was performed or attempted to be performed to any civil or criminal action or any type of criminal or civil penalty or liability under the new Code chapter. The bill provides severability provisions. The bill takes effect upon enactment.","This bill creates the Iowa Human Life Protection Act, a comprehensive law aimed at severely restricting abortion in the state. The bill prohibits elective abortions from the moment of fertilization, making it unlawful for anyone to perform, aid, or abet an abortion, with only narrow exceptions for medical emergencies. The legislation introduces a unique enforcement mechanism through qui tam actions, which allows private citizens to sue anyone involved in providing or facilitating abortions, including individuals who help someone obtain abortion-inducing drugs, internet service providers, or government contractors. Potential plaintiffs can seek significant damages, including at least $10,000 in civil penalties and potentially $100,000 in punitive damages. The bill also includes provisions to block access to abortion-related information online, prohibit government entities from entering into transactions with abortion providers, and prevent internet service providers and publicly owned buildings from allowing access to abortion-related content. Notably, the law explicitly states that pregnant women themselves cannot be criminally or civilly prosecuted under this act. The bill is part of a broader legislative effort to restrict abortion access following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, and it includes extensive findings that define human life as beginning at fertilization and characterize abortion as a ""murderous act of violence.""","Bill","Justice","“Major Bodily Function”, Bona Fide Research, Major Bodily Function, Normal Cell Growth, Omissions Giving Rise, Publicly Owned Buildings, Qui Tam Libability, Species Homo Sapiens, Due Process Clause, Obtain Elective Abortions","Introduced, referred to Judiciary.

The bill requires a private office, freestanding organized outpatient health facility, hospital, or other facility in which medication abortions are performed to conspicuously post a sign in a location as described in the bill relating to the effectiveness and possibility of avoiding, ceasing, or even reversing the effects of a medication abortion. The bill requires that, except in the case of a medical emergency, in addition to compliance with the abortion prerequisites of Code chapter 146A, a physician shall not perform or attempt to perform a medication abortion unless the physician who will perform the medication abortion, the referring physician, or an agent of either physician obtains written certification from the pregnant woman.

Following the dispensing of an abortion-inducing drug, the attending physician or an agent of the attending physician shall provide written medical discharge instructions to the woman which must include the statement specified in the bill. The bill requires HHS to publish and to make available on HHS’s internet site, materials designed to inform a woman of the possibility of reversing the effects of a medication abortion if the woman changes her mind, and information on and assistance with the resources that may be available to help reverse the effects of a medication abortion. The bill also prohibits a person from dispensing mifepristone to a patient in this state for use by such patient in inducing a medication abortion unless the mifepristone is dispensed directly to such patient in a health care setting. Failure of a physician to comply with the bill is grounds for licensee discipline. The bill also provides that the bill shall not be construed to create or recognize a right to an abortion or to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed.","This bill establishes new regulations for medication abortions in Iowa, requiring healthcare facilities to post signs indicating that medication abortions may be reversible and physicians must obtain written certification that patients have been informed about potential abortion reversal. The bill defines key terms like ""abortion-inducing drug"" (specifically mentioning mifepristone and misoprostol) and ""medication abortion,"" and mandates that physicians provide patients with detailed information about abortion risks and potential reversal options. Facilities must display signs stating that medication abortions are not always effective and that reversal might be possible, with specific requirements for sign size and placement in waiting rooms and consultation areas. The bill requires physicians to provide written discharge instructions including information about potential abortion reversal and maintain documentation of these communications. Additionally, the legislation stipulates that mifepristone can only be dispensed directly to patients in healthcare settings, and failure to comply with these requirements could result in disciplinary action against a physician's medical license.

"https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1815254","IA","SF188","A bill for an act relating to health insurance coverage for contraceptive devices, drugs, and services.","This bill relates to health insurance coverage for contraceptive devices, drugs, and services. The bill prohibits a policy, contract, or plan providing for third-party payment or prepayment of health or medical expenses (policy), and that provides coverage for prescription drugs, from excluding or restricting benefits for contraceptive drugs, contraceptive devices (contraceptives), or generic equivalents, if the policy provides benefits for other prescription drugs or devices. “Contraceptive device” and “contraceptive drug” are defined in the bill. The bill also prohibits a policy from excluding or restricting benefits for outpatient contraceptive services that are provided for the purpose of preventing conception if the policy provides benefits for other outpatient services provided by a health care professional (professional). A policy is prohibited from denying to an individual eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll in or renew coverage under the terms of the policy because of the individual’s use or potential use of contraceptives or outpatient contraceptive services; providing a monetary payment or rebate to a covered individual to encourage such individual to accept less than the minimum benefits provided for under the bill; penalizing, reducing, or limiting the reimbursement to a professional because such professional prescribes contraceptives or provides contraceptive services; and from providing incentives to a professional to induce such professional to withhold from a covered individual contraceptives or contraceptive services. The bill also prohibits a policy from imposing upon any covered individual any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment for benefits for contraceptives or contraceptive services. Under the bill, a policy that provides coverage for more than one therapeutically equivalent version of a contraceptive may impose cost-sharing requirements, provided that at least one therapeutically equivalent version of the contraceptive is available without cost-sharing. If a covered individual’s professional recommends a particular contraceptive based on a determination of medical need, a policy shall provide coverage for the recommended contraceptive without cost-sharing. The bill does not limit or otherwise discourage the use of generic equivalent drugs approved by the United States food and drug administration, whenever available and appropriate. When a brand-name drug is requested by a covered individual and a suitable generic equivalent is available and appropriate, the bill does not prohibit a third-party payor from requiring the covered individual to pay a deductible, coinsurance, or copayment, in addition to the difference of the cost of the brand-name drug less the maximum covered amount for a generic equivalent. The bill does not require a third-party payor under a policy to provide benefits for experimental or investigational contraceptives, or experimental or investigational contraceptive services, except to the extent that such policy provides coverage for other experimental or investigational outpatient prescription drugs or devices, or experimental or investigational outpatient health care services. A policy shall not impose any burdensome restrictions or delays on the coverage required by the bill and shall provide clear, written, and complete information on its internet site, and by mail upon request, about the contraceptive coverage included and excluded from the offered plans. A policy shall include a coverage provision. The policy shall provide that the policyholder may reject the coverage provision at the option of the policyholder. The bill applies to third-party payment provider contracts, policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state, on or after January 1, 2026, by the third-party payment providers enumerated in the bill. The bill specifies the types of specialized health-related insurance not subject to the bill.","This bill proposes comprehensive requirements for health insurance coverage of contraceptive drugs, devices, and services in Iowa. The bill mandates that health insurance policies providing prescription drug coverage cannot exclude or restrict benefits for contraceptive medications, devices, or services if they offer similar benefits for non-contraceptive prescriptions. Specifically, insurers are prohibited from denying coverage, providing monetary incentives to discourage use, penalizing healthcare professionals for prescribing contraceptives, or imposing deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance for contraceptive services. The bill defines key terms like ""contraceptive device"" and ""medical need"" and allows insurers to offer multiple therapeutically equivalent versions of contraceptives with cost-sharing, but requires coverage without cost-sharing if a healthcare professional recommends a specific contraceptive based on medical need. The legislation applies to various types of health insurance policies, including individual and group plans, and will take effect on January 1, 2026. The bill notably excludes certain types of specialized insurance from these requirements and includes a provision allowing policyholders to opt out of the contraceptive coverage. The bill also repeals a previous section of law related to contraceptive coverage, effectively updating and expanding existing regulations.","Bill","Business and Industry","Public Employees Pursuant, Maximum Covered Amount, Therapeutically Equivalent Version, Hospital Confinement Indemnity, Medical-Surgical Expense Coverage, Specialized Health-Related Insurance, Investigational Contraceptive Service, Suitable Generic Equivalent, Outpatient Contraceptive Services, Outpatient Services Provided","Subcommittee: Driscoll, Trone Garriott, and Warme.

The bill maintains strict requirements for chemical abortions, including physician certification of pregnancy location, ability to provide emergency surgical intervention, and patient follow-up. It also reinforces the existing prohibition on abortions after fetal heartbeat detection, with exceptions for medical emergencies, lethal fetal anomalies, and reported cases of rape or incest.

The bill introduces new restrictions such as requiring a second physician to be present during viable pregnancies to provide care for any child born alive, mandating specific reporting requirements for abortions, and creating new potential grounds for disciplinary action against physicians who perform abortions outside of specific approved facilities or in a manner deemed willful and wanton. Additionally, the bill amends multiple existing laws to add provisions related to abortion, including changing definitions in various medical practice acts, insurance codes, and criminal statutes to more narrowly define when and how abortions can be performed. The bill also introduces new protections for healthcare providers who refuse to participate in abortion procedures and creates potential legal mechanisms for fathers to seek injunctions against abortions in certain circumstances.

The bill also gives the state attorney general concurrent jurisdiction in cases involving abortion-inducing drugs and imposes disciplinary measures on medical practitioners who violate these provisions. Healthcare providers are required to report detailed information about abortions, and the bill restricts the use of telehealth for abortion-related prescriptions. The legislation includes provisions for the disposal of fetal remains and adds new criminal statutes related to the transfer and collection of fetal tissue, with the overall intent of creating significant legal barriers to obtaining abortion-inducing drugs in Indiana.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Constitutional Convention Delegates, Deep Vein Thrombosis, Common Terminology Criteria, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, Previous Live Births, Lethal Fetal Anomaly, Routine Dental Services, Perinatal Hospice Providers, Previous Calendar Quarter, Recent Calendar Quarter","Senator Byrne added as second author","01/16/2025","5","Mike Young (R)*, Gary Byrne (R)*, Blake Doriot (R), Jim Tomes (R), Andy Zay (R)","In Committee","4","1","159","01/02/2025","01/02/2025","",""

The legislation modifies existing statutes to require annual inspections of abortion clinics, mandate specific reporting requirements, and establish detailed provisions for abortion procedures. Key changes include removing the eight-week limitation on abortion-inducing drugs, allowing (rather than requiring) the revocation of a physician's license for performing an abortion improperly, and narrowing the circumstances under which abortions can be performed. The bill also updates provisions related to informed consent, mandatory reporting of abortion complications, and restrictions on abortions based on factors like fetal disability or sex. Additionally, the bill restricts abortion coverage in health insurance plans, now only allowing coverage in cases of rape, incest, or when necessary to prevent death or substantial permanent impairment of the pregnant woman's health.

The bill also prohibits the manufacture, distribution, prescription, or sale of abortion-inducing drugs like mifepristone. A key feature of the legislation is its enforcement mechanism, which allows any person to bring a civil lawsuit against anyone who performs an abortion or aids and abets an abortion, with potential statutory damages of at least $10,000 per violation. The bill explicitly prevents state agencies or prosecutors from enforcing the abortion ban, instead relying entirely on private civil actions.

It amends existing laws to eliminate previous exceptions for medical procedures, legal abortions, and actions taken by a mother or medical professional, leaving only two narrow exceptions: life-saving medical procedures for a pregnant woman that attempt to also save the unborn child's life, and spontaneous miscarriages. The bill also modifies criminal defense provisions, effectively removing the ability to use certain legal defenses in cases involving the death of an unborn child. Notably, these changes will only apply prospectively, starting July 1, 2025, and are designed to align with the bill's interpretation of the Kansas Constitution's right to life, which the bill argues was incorrectly interpreted by the state Supreme Court in a 2019 decision.

The bill removes numerous existing restrictions on abortion, repealing many statutes that previously regulated abortion procedures, reporting requirements, and medical practices. Key changes include eliminating mandatory waiting periods, detailed reporting requirements, and constraints on abortion providers. The bill defines medical terms like ""abortion"" and ""medical emergency"" and allows abortion services in various healthcare settings, including public health departments and state-sponsored health insurance plans.

The legislation also provides legal protections for individuals seeking reproductive healthcare, allowing them to seek injunctive relief and damages if their rights are violated. It removes criminal penalties for healthcare providers performing abortions and eliminates many previous reporting and procedural requirements that had created barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare.

Additionally, the bill allows for abortion services in cases of medical necessity, protects healthcare providers' ability to provide reproductive care, and ensures that individuals cannot be discriminated against for seeking or refusing reproductive healthcare services. The changes are comprehensive, effectively dismantling many of Kentucky's previous restrictive abortion laws and establishing a broader framework of reproductive rights and medical autonomy.","Bill","Justice","Female Genital Mutilation, Flexible Spending Accounts, Lysinuric Protein Intolerance, Outstanding Accounts Receivable, Species Homo Sapiens, Food Protein Allergies, Operations Generally Offered, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Promote Lifelong Learning","to Judiciary (H)","02/14/2025","8","Lindsey Burke (D)*, Anne Donworth (D), George Brown (D), Adrielle Camuel (D), Nima Kulkarni (D), Matthew Lehman (D), Pamela Stevenson (D), Lisa Willner (D)","In Committee","3","1","316","02/11/2025","02/12/2025","",""

The bill also prohibits Maryland judges from issuing subpoenas or orders related to legally protected health care unless the underlying actions would constitute a crime in Maryland. Additionally, the bill protects healthcare practitioners from professional disciplinary actions for providing these services in accordance with state standards and laws. The Governor is also barred from surrendering individuals to other states for actions related to legally protected health care that would not be considered criminal in Maryland.

By repealing this section, the bill would eliminate the requirement for MaineCare to cover abortion services and remove the state's obligation to pay for abortion services that are not federally approved.

First, it requires more detailed reporting of abortion procedures, mandating that healthcare professionals submit reports to the Department of Health and Human Services within 10 days after each abortion, including specific demographic information like the patient's age, race, marital status, and education level. Second, the bill narrows the circumstances under which abortions can be performed after fetal viability, allowing such procedures only when medically necessary to preserve the mother's life or health, or when the fetus is diagnosed with a ""lethal fetal anomaly"" - defined as a condition that will, with reasonable certainty, result in the child's death within 3 months after birth. Third, the bill reestablishes criminal penalties for performing abortions without proper licensing, making it a Class C crime for unlicensed individuals to perform or assist in performing an abortion, and a Class D crime for performing an abortion after viability when it is not medically necessary.

This appears to be part of a broader effort to precisely define and potentially restrict certain types of medical care related to reproduction and gender.","Bill","","Irreversible Physical Impairment, Major Bodily Function, Registered Identification Mark, Medical Conditions Involved, Dead Unborn Child, Legal Relationship Created, Reasonable Medical Judgment, Reproductive Health Care, Unborn Child, Medical Judgment","Read Second Time (H)","02/03/2025","1","Brian Seitz (R)*","Introduced","2","1","59","01/30/2025","01/30/2025","",""

The legislation establishes several key restrictions: it prevents physicians from performing an abortion if they know the pregnancy was specifically conceived to obtain fetal organs or tissue for transplantation, prohibits the utilization of fetal organs or tissue from an abortion for any purpose, and bans offering any monetary or other inducements to a woman or potential father to conceive a child or procure an abortion for the purpose of obtaining fetal organs or tissue. The bill also forbids anyone from knowingly offering or receiving compensation for fetal organs or tissue, with a narrow exception allowing payment for burial, final disposition, pathological examination, autopsy, or postmortem examination of fetal remains. By adding a new subsection to an existing law, the legislation aims to create a comprehensive legal framework that restricts the potential use of fetal tissue from abortions across multiple contexts, effectively preventing what the bill's sponsors likely view as the commodification or utilization of fetal remains.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Providing Fetal Organs, Fetal Organs, Fetal Remains, Final Disposition, Held  Invalid, Lieu Thereof, Pathological Examination, Postmortem Examination, Unborn Child, Valuable Consideration","Public Hearing Completed (H)","03/11/2025","1","Becky Laubinger (R)*","In Committee","5","1","40","02/10/2025","02/10/2025","",""

The bill expands the legislative intent behind abortion regulations, including new language about research indicating women may feel coerced into abortions and adding provisions to help women report potential coercion, abuse, or human trafficking. It revises the informed consent process by requiring healthcare providers to ask women specific questions about potential pressure, domestic violence, or human trafficking before an abortion. The bill mandates that providers offer women the opportunity to contact national domestic violence and human trafficking hotlines if they disclose being in such situations. Additionally, the bill eliminates some previously defined terms related to abortion risks and modifies the requirements for civil actions related to abortions. The legislation provides women with more comprehensive information before an abortion, including details about medical risks, probable gestational age of the fetus, and potential alternatives to abortion. It also maintains and slightly expands provisions that allow women to pursue civil actions if abortion providers fail to follow the specified consent and screening procedures. The bill aims to provide additional protections and information for women considering an abortion while creating more stringent requirements for healthcare providers performing the procedure.","Bill","Justice","Major Bodily Function, Reissue Revised Statutes, Sucking Fetal Parts, Legislatively Encouraging Abortions, Written Certifications Prescribed, Peer-Reviewed Journals Indexed, Registered Nurse Licensed, Social Worker Licensed, Written Certification Prescribed, Quantifiable Risk Rates","Hunt MO177 Recommit to the Judiciary Committee filed","04/14/2025","1","Tanya Storer (NP)*","In Committee","21","1","104","01/22/2025","01/22/2025","",""

This bill also adds that no regulatory or law enforcement agency has the authority to penalize a health care provider for performing an abortion before 15 weeks gestational age except as specifically provided by law.","This bill introduces new restrictions on elective abortions in New Hampshire by establishing a 15-week gestational age limit for abortions, with exceptions only for medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities incompatible with life. The bill requires healthcare providers to determine a fetus's probable gestational age through an ultrasound examination before performing an abortion after 15 weeks, and mandates that abortions performed under medical emergency circumstances must be reported to the medical facility or Department of Health and Human Services. Healthcare providers who knowingly perform abortions in violation of these restrictions could face significant penalties, including being charged with a class B felony and fined between $10,000 and $100,000. The bill also allows civil remedies for the woman, her spouse, or maternal grandparents in certain circumstances, and provides a mechanism for healthcare providers to seek review by the New Hampshire Board of Medicine regarding the medical necessity of an abortion.

Health Insurance. The bill provides that any State program that provides benefits for pregnancy-related care will also provide benefits for the termination of pregnancy, and that health insurance coverage will also include coverage for termination of pregnancy without a deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other cost-sharing requirement. Under the bill, upon request of a religious employer, a health insurer will grant an exclusion if the coverage conflicts with the religious employer's bona fide religious beliefs and practices. Other States' Civil Actions. The bill declares that a law of another state that authorizes a person to bring a civil action against a person or entity for undertaking any of the following conduct is contrary to the public policy of this State: (1) receiving or seeking an abortion; (2) performing or inducing an abortion; (3) knowingly engaging in conduct that aids or abets the performance, receipt, or inducement of an abortion; or (4) attempting or intending to engage in the conduct described above. This provision of the bill will not apply to an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the laws of this State, or an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the laws of another state and for which a similar claim would exist under the laws of this State, including, but not limited to, an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a person related to the person's profession or occupation. Crime: Interference with Reproductive Health Services. The bill creates the new crime of ""interference with reproductive health services."" Among other provisions, a person is guilty of the crime if the person purposely or knowingly, with purpose to unlawfully restrict another's access to or receipt or provision of reproductive health services or to intimidate the person from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant: (1) inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury; (2) obstructs any person seeking to enter into or exit from a reproductive health services facility or place of religious worship; (3) intimidates, threatens or coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any person or entity because that person or entity is a reproductive health services patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant; (4) damages, defaces, or destroys the property of a person, entity, or facility, or attempts to do so, because the person, entity, or facility is a reproductive health services patient, provider, assistant, volunteer, or facility; (5) videotapes, films, photographs, or records by electronic means, within 100 feet of the entrance to a reproductive health services facility, a patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant without that person's consent, with purpose to intimidate the person from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant; or (6) discloses or distributes a videotape, film, photograph, or recording of the person with purpose to intimidate the person from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant. Interference with reproductive health services is a crime of the fourth degree, but is a crime of the second degree if the victim suffers significant bodily injury or serious bodily injury. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both; a crime of the second degree, by a term of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both. Dispersal of Gatherings. The bill authorizes the Attorney General or any law enforcement officer to order the immediate dispersal of a gathering that substantially impedes access to or departure from an entrance or driveway to a reproductive health care facility during the business hours of the facility. Failure to comply with a dispersal order is a disorderly persons offense. A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. Civil Action: Interference with Reproductive Health Services. The bill also authorizes a person to bring a civil action against a person who unlawfully interferes with another person's reproductive health services. The court may award injunctive relief; compensatory damages in an amount not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $1,000 for each violation; punitive damages upon proof of willful or reckless disregard of the law; reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs; and other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate. Under the bill, the Attorney General may bring a civil action to enjoin a violation of the law, for compensatory damages, and for the assessment of a civil penalty against each person who violates the law. The civil penalty imposed will be up to, but not exceeding, $10,000 for a first violation, and $25,000 for any subsequent violation. Reproductive Health Access Fund. The bill creates the ""Reproductive Health Access Fund,"" which will be credited with moneys from an appropriation of $20 million made pursuant to the bill, interest, and any money from any other source. The fund will be used for the following purposes, established pursuant to the bill: (1) $5 million will be appropriated for the ""Abortion Care Clinical Training Program""; (2) $5 million for the ""Reproductive Health Security Grant Program""; and (3) $10 million for the ""Reproductive Health Care Facility Grant Program"". The ""Abortion Care Clinical Training Program"" will provide grants to develop and sustain abortion care training programs; continuing education programs for physicians through professional associations or other clinical education programs; and establish training program requirements that are consistent with evidence-based training standards, comply with applicable State law and regulations, and focus on providing culturally congruent care and include implicit bias training. The ""Reproductive Health Security Grant Program"" in the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness will provide grants to eligible reproductive health care facilities which the Director of the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness determines are at a high risk of being the target of unlawful activity, including acts of violence, property damage, vandalism, and harassment. Grants provided under the program will be used to hire security personnel and target-hardening equipment. The ""Reproductive Health Facility Grant Program"" will be used to support establishing or renovating existing health care facilities, investments in technology to facilitate care, the recruitment and retention of staff, and other operational needs that increase abortion care. Needs Assessment. The bill requires the Department of Health to conduct a Statewide needs assessment to examine the gaps in delivery of reproductive health services in the State, including the impact that out-of-State restrictions have had on the need for reproductive health services and the provider network in the State. Medicaid Coverage. Under the bill, the Department of Human Services will ensure that expenses incurred for abortion services will be provided with no cost-sharing to persons served under the Medicaid program. Medical Malpractice Insurers. The bill bars medical malpractice insurers from taking any adverse action, including loss of coverage, sanctions, fines, penalties, or rate increases, against an insured for providing or facilitating an abortion or reproductive health care service based solely on the fact that the patient receiving the service is a resident of a state where providing or facilitating an abortion or reproductive health care service is illegal. Licensing Boards. Finally, the bill provides that a licensing board cannot refuse to admit a person to an examination and cannot suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew any certificate, registration, or license based solely on grounds that the applicant or the holder of the certificate, registration, or license provided, authorized, participated in, referred for, or assisted with any health care, medical service, or procedure related to an abortion for a person who resides in a jurisdiction where these acts are illegal, if the acts would not be a basis for these sanctions in this State. Repealers. The bill repeals the following statutes, which have either been obviated by court decisions or would be obviated by this bill: -- N.J.S.A.2A:65A-5 through N.J.S.A.2A:65A-7 (banned partial birth abortions); -- N.J.S.A.9:17A-1.1 through N.J.S.A.9:17A-1.12 (required parental notification for minors' abortions); -- N.J.S.A.26:2S-39, N.J.S.A.52:14-17.29hh, and N.J.S.A.52:14-17.46.6q (exempted religious employers from possible requirement that health insurance issued in the State include abortion coverage); and -- N.J.S.A.30:4D-6.1 (barred Medicaid payment for abortion except where necessary to save the woman's life).","This bill implements various measures to strengthen access to reproductive health care in the State. It provides that any State program that provides benefits for pregnancy-related care will also provide benefits for the termination of pregnancy, and that health insurance coverage will also include coverage for termination of pregnancy without cost-sharing. The bill also declares that laws of other states that authorize civil actions against those who receive, provide, or assist with abortions are contrary to the public policy of New Jersey. It creates the new crime of ""interference with reproductive health services"" and authorizes civil actions and penalties for such interference. The bill appropriates $20 million to establish the ""Reproductive Health Access Fund"" which will support an abortion care training program, a security grant program for reproductive health care facilities, and a grant program for reproductive health care facilities.

For high-deductible health plans, these provisions will take effect after the insured's deductible is met. The bill applies to various types of health insurance contracts, including group and individual plans, and allows for some exceptions for religious entities.

Exceptions to the ultrasound requirement are only allowed in medical emergencies, which are narrowly defined as situations where immediate termination is necessary to prevent the pregnant person's death or avoid substantial and irreversible physical impairment of major bodily functions. For violations of these requirements, healthcare providers will face a civil penalty of at least $10,000 per incident, with these penalties to be deposited into the Oregon Student Assistance Fund to provide scholarships for current and former foster children. The bill also amends existing Oregon law to incorporate these new restrictions while maintaining language about protecting reproductive health rights.","Bill","Health and Social Services","Applicable Readability Standards, Flesch Readability Score, Health Care Provider, Reproductive Health Care, Deposit Penalties Assessed, Major Bodily Functions, Promote Public Health, Including Psycho- Logical, Measure Digest Written, Physician Assistant Licensed","Referred to Behavioral Health and Health Care.","02/20/2025","1","Werner Reschke (R)*","In Committee","2","1","62","02/17/2025","02/18/2025","",""

The legislation emphasizes Virginia's commitment to protecting access to abortion and gender-affirming care, stating that its borders are open to those seeking such services and that criminal investigations or convictions based on providing these services in other jurisdictions are contrary to Virginia's public policy.","Bill","Education, Health and Social Services, Justice","Prima Facie Evidence, Future Menstrual Health, Menstrual Health Data, Permit Abortion Care, Grand Jury Investigation, Protected Health Care, Authorized Legal Representative, Liability Derived Therefrom, Peace Officer Commanding, Alleged Violation Involves","Left in Courts of Justice","11/19/2024","2","Ghazala Hashmi (D)*, Jennifer Boysko (D)","In Committee","8","1","125","08/16/2024","01/09/2024","",""

The bill prohibits a health insurance carrier from imposing upon any person receiving contraceptive benefits pursuant to the provisions of the bill any copayment, coinsurance payment, or fee, except in certain circumstances. This bill is identical to HB 2371.","This bill establishes a new legal chapter in Virginia addressing contraception access and protections. It explicitly affirms the right of individuals to access contraception, drawing legal precedent from two landmark Supreme Court cases (Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird) that historically established constitutional privacy protections related to contraception. The bill creates a nuanced policy that simultaneously protects individual access to contraception while also providing a religious and conscientious objection exemption for private institutions and healthcare providers. Specifically, while the bill asserts a public policy supporting contraception access, it also allows physicians, private institutions, and their employees to refuse providing contraception, contraceptive procedures, supplies, or information if doing so conflicts with their religious or moral beliefs. This exemption means that such entities cannot be legally penalized or held liable for declining to offer contraceptive services based on these objections. The bill appears designed to balance individual reproductive rights with institutional religious freedom, creating a framework that respects both principles.","Bill","Budget and Finance, Business and Industry","Health Insurance Carrier, Health Insurance, Coinsurance Payment, Conscientious Objection, Contraceptive Drugs, Contraceptive Procedures, Held Liable, Individuals Possess, Outpatient Basis, Prescription Drugs","Vetoed by Governor","05/02/2025","4","Jennifer Carroll Foy (D)*, Ghazala Hashmi (D), Kannan Srinivasan (D), Angelia Williams Graves (D)","Vetoed","51","4","50","01/01/2025","03/25/2025","",""

It would eliminate specific responsibility for licensed health care providers who provide services at a limited-services pregnancy center for the services provided at the center and would remove language indicating that failure to ensure those services are conducted in accordance with the law could constitute unprofessional conduct. The bill would also clarify and expand the types of actions that could be considered unprofessional conduct for physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, and naturopathic physicians under their licensure statutes. The bill would eliminate restrictions on a physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse prescribing medication to terminate an individual’s pregnancy based on asynchronous S.28 electronic or other online communication with the individual. It would also specify that fetal death reports required by law must be kept confidential.","This bill proposes several significant changes to healthcare services and professional regulations in Vermont. It expands protections for healthcare providers offering legally protected health care activities, such as reproductive and gender-affirming services, by prohibiting professional disciplinary actions based solely on providing these services. The bill broadens the definition of unprofessional conduct to include misleading advertising about health care services and removes specific restrictions on limited-services pregnancy centers. It allows healthcare professionals to prescribe medication for pregnancy termination using online questionnaires and introduces confidentiality protections for prescribers and pharmacists involved in gender-affirming or reproductive health care services. The legislation also extends legal protections to individuals who have previously provided such services in other jurisdictions, ensuring they cannot be penalized for actions that would have been legal in Vermont. Additionally, the bill strengthens privacy provisions by limiting the disclosure of protected health information related to legally protected health care activities and restricts public agencies from cooperating with investigations aimed at imposing liability on individuals seeking or providing such services.","Bill","Health and Social Services","“Natural Organic Reduction”, Accompanying Printed Materials, Exercising Undue Influence, Proper Physician-Patient Relationship, Proper Provider-Patient Relationship, Taking Improper Advantage, Broadens Health Disparity, Initial Admission Orders, Judicial Proceedingsorder Issued, Offers Obstetric Ultrasounds","Delivered to Governor on May 7, 2025","05/07/2025","6","Ruth Hardy (D)*, Ginny Lyons (D), Alison Clarkson (D), Martine Gulick (D), Tanya Vyhovsky (D), Becca White (D)","Passed","54","3","113","01/29/2025","04/29/2025","",""

The legislation affirms that reproductive healthcare is a long-established right in Washington state and aims to provide the strongest possible protections for pregnant patients, especially in light of uncertainty at the federal level. Specifically, the bill requires hospitals to provide treatment to pregnant persons with emergency medical conditions consistent with the applicable standard of care, which may include terminating a pregnancy if that is medically appropriate. Importantly, the bill stipulates that neither the continuation of pregnancy nor the health of an embryo or fetus can be a basis for withholding care from the pregnant person or prioritizing the fetus over the patient's health and safety without the patient's informed consent. The bill also expands the legal definition of ""emergency medical condition"" to include specific pregnancy-related complications like ectopic pregnancy, emergent pregnancy complications, and hypertensive disorders.

The bill defines these terms in detail, emphasizing informed consent and the perspective that a preborn child is alive from the moment of fertilization. Medical schools that do not comply with these educational requirements could face potential loss of state funding, as determined by the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability.

Health insurance plans are prohibited from imposing additional cost-sharing, waiting periods, or restrictions on contraceptive coverage, and cannot deny coverage or penalize healthcare professionals for providing these services. Religious employers are still allowed to exclude contraceptive and sterilization services that conflict with their religious tenets, but must provide written notice to enrollees and offer the option to purchase a separate rider for such coverage.
